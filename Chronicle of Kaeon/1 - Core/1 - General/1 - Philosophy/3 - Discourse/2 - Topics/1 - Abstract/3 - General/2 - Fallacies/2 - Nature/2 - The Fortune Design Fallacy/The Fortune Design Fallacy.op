The Fortune Design Fallacy

	Philosophy

		-
			The fortune design fallacy is the tendency to assume that, because something occurred
			which from one's perspective was both highly unlikely and highly convenient, that it is
			evidence of some sort of designed plan at work, regardless of the unfortunate
			circumstances which befall those far more pious towards such ideas.
