Gradient Principle

	Philosophy

		-
			The gradient principle is the principle that policies with time based factors,
			specifically sentencing policies, should have time based outcomes.

			Therefore, the scale of said outcomes should be determined by gradient functions which
			take said time based factors as arguments.
