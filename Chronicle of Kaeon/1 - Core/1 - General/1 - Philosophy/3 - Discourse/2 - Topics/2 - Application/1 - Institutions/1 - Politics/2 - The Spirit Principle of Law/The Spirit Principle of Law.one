The Spirit Principle of Law

	Philosophy

		-
			The spirit principle of law is the notion that to every written law or principle there
			is a corresponding spirit that must be taken into account in said writing's
			interpretation.

			This spirit can be said to have a static component, that being the intentions of the
			writing's author, and a dynamic component, that being how it has been historically been
			interpreted and how it relates to contemporary philosophical principles.
