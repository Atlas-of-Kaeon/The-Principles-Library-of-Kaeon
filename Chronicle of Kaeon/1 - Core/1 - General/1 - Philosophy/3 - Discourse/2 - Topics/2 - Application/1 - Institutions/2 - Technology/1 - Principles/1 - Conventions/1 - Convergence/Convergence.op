Convergence

	Philosophy

		-
			The principle of convergence states that when designing a system, it should first be
			determined what the central elements of said system have in common. Then, the first
			components of said system to be created should serve these common needs.

			Then, for the remaining elements of the system should be grouped according to common
			needs and the process should be repeated on each group.
