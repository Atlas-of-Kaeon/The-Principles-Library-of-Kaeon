Adaptive Motivation

	Philosophy

		-
			Adaptive motivation is the use of the expectations of others as motivation, the
			specifics of which change relative to what said expectations are.

			The goal with negative expectations is to prove them wrong, and the goal with positive
			expectations is to prove them right.
