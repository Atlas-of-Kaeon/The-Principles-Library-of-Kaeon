Discussion Types

	Philosophy

		-
			The two basic types of discussion are preaching, where one person speaks unimpeded to a
			group, which is often large, and exchange, where small groups of people alternate
			talking between one another.

			Preaching is better for conveying pathos, while exchange is better for conveying logos.
