Less or Equal
	
	Philosophy
		
		-
			The less or equal command contains the content "Less or Equal". It may have an
			indefinite number of children, each of which return a number.
			
			It will return true if the number returned by the every child except for the last child
			is less than or equal to than the number returned by the following child, and return
			false otherwise.
