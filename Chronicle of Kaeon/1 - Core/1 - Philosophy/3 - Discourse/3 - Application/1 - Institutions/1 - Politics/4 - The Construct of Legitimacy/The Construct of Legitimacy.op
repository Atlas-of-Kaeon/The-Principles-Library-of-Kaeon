The Construct of Legitimacy

	Philosophy

		-
			Any idea or instituition only has as much legitimacy with respect to any individual or
			group as said party allows it to have.

			An instituition may use any number of arguments and tactics, including force, to
			proclaim and maintain its legitimacy, but said legitimacy is still ultimately a social
			construct.
