Principles of Writing

	Philosophy

		-
			One ought to commit as many of their ideas to writing as possible, and to catalog,
			preserve, and publish them online, insofar as it is safe to do so.

			This serves to allow them to take on much larger endeavors than they would be able to
			if all their ideas were committed to memory, guaruntees that their work can survive
			anything that would otherwise destroy it, and ensures that they have a legacy to leave
			behind.
