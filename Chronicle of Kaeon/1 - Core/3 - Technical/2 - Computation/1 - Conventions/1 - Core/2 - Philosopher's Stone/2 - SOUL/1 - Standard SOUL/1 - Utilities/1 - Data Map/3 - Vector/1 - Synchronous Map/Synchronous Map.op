Synchronous Map

	Philosophy

		-
			A synchronous map is a data map vector in which each data map has the same number of
			input-output pairs, with the same input vectors across each corresponding input-ouptut
			pair, while not necessarily sharing the same output values across each corresponding
			input-output pair.
