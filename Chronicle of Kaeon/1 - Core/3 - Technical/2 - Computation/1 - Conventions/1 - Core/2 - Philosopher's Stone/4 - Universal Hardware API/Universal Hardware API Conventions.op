Universal Hardware API Conventions

	Philosophy

		-
			This document lists several conventions for the universal hardware API.
		-

	Principles

		Standards

			HTTP

				-
					An endpoint upon which the universal hardware API operates shall be implemented
					as an HTTP server.
				-

			Cellular

				-
					A device upon which the universal hardware API operates shall receive data
					through a cellular network.
				-

		Recommendations

			Documentation

				-
					An HTTP GET request to the base route of the server of a device that follows
					the protocol shall return a string containing a document file specifying the
					routes provided by said device's server.
				-

			Modification

				-
					Ideally, a device that follows the protocol should have some sort of secure
					mechanism in place to manually override its hard coded settings.
				-

			HTTPS

				-
					For security purposes, universal hardware API servers should run use HTTPS.
				-

		Options

			Autonomous Behavior

				-
					A device that follows the protocol may act autonomously or according to other
					stimuli when not being directly controlled via HTTP calls.
				-

			GUI Pages

				-
					A device that follows the protocol may use its server to serve web pages that
					provide graphical interfaces for some or all of its functionality.
				-

			Security

				-
					A device that follows the protocol may restrict the use of some or all of its
					functionality to specific users, who must provide credentials in order to prove
					their identity.
				-

			Search

				-
					A device that follows the protocol may make itself publicly discoverable via
					certain search engines.
				-

		Acronym

			-
				The universal hardware API can be referred to as UHAPI ("you-happy") for short.
