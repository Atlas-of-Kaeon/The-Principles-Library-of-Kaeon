Virtual Hardware

	Philosophy

		-
			Virtual hardware is a simulation of a given physical machine that software may interact
			with in the same manner that it would the real equivalent.
			
			Among other things, this would allow one to conserve the resources needed to build said
			machine at least until said resources are availble and the concept has been
			sufficiently proven.
