Shadow Module

	Philosophy

		-
			A shadow module is a module that is attached to a pre-existing module referred to as
			the host module.

			A shadow module will dynamically modify its host module at runtime. A unit of code that
			is inserted into a host module to act as a interface to a shadow module is called a
			shadow point.
