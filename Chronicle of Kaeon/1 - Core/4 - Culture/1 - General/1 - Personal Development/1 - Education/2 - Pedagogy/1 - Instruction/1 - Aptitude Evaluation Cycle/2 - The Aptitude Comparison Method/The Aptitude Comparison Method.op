			is a personal tutor.

	Principles

		Progression

			-
				The process should begin where the target scales themselves to the level of the
				subject so as to ensure that the subject becomes familiar with the basics of the
				discipline.

				This should progress quickly towards the point where the target does not hold back
				at all, save for in any physical activity where the subject could be injured, and
				as the attempts progess, the subject's goal should be to outdo the target, however
				lofty that goal may be at any point in the process.

				Additionally, the target should always assist the subject in identifying the gaps
				in their skill following every attempt.
			-

		Skill Gap

			-
				This method works better the larger the skill gap is between the subject and the
				target.

				As such, it is a very good way to educate children.
			-

		Ghost Target

			-
				If no suitable target can be employed for the process, one can work with an
				imaginary target of a far higher skill level than themselves, though this takes a
				high amount of discipline.
