The Spirit Principle

	Philosophy

		-
			The spirit principle is the notion that any symbolic rendering of an idea is liable to
			represent an imperfect approximation of it, thus in interpreting any symbolic rendering
			of an idea, one ought to take into account both the objective and subjective elements
			of the abstract form the idea, so as to discern the spirit behind the symbols.
