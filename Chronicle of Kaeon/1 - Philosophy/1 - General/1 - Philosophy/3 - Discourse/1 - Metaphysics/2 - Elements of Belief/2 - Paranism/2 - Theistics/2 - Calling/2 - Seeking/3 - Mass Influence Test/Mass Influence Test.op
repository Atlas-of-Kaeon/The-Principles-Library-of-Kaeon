Mass Influence Test

	Philosophy

		-
			A mass influence test is an attempt to communicate with a "supernatural" entity by
			asking them to manipulate the outcome of an otherwise random event, performed the same
			way in multiple separate instances.

			A consistent result across a very large sample size could effectively confirm the
			existence of the entity, assuming that they are willing to cooperate, and could also
			be used to answer a question asked of said entity assuming that different outcomes to
			the otherwise random event are taken to correspond to specific answers to said
			question.

			The integrity of the test is contingent upon ensuring that the outcome of the otherwise
			random events are not artificially tampered with. Additionally, it is important to note
			that while consistent results across a sufficiently large sample would effectively
			prove the existence of the entity, inconsistent results would not necessarily disprove
			it.

	Principles

		Divination Consistency Test

			-
				A close relative of the mass influence test is the divination consistency test,
				where a given method of divination is tested to see how consistently its
				predictions are accurate.

				If the results for a large enough sample are statistically significant, said method
				of divination may warrant proper analysis in a controlled environment.

		Evidence

			-
				To date, claims regarding the success tests similar to mass influence tests and
				divination consistency tests are rare, and when they are presented, tend to be of
				dubious origin.
