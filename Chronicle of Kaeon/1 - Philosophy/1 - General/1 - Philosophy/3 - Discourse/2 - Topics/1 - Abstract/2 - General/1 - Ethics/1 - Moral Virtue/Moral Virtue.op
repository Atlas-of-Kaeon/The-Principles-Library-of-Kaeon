Moral Virtue

	Philosophy

		-
			While actions ought to be judged in the terms of good and bad on the basis of their
			consequences, beings who cause said actions to occur ought to be judged in the terms of
			righteousness and evil on the basis of the intended consequences of their choices,
			collectively from which the moral virtue of said beings can be determined.
