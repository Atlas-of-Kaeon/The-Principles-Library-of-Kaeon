Legal Checkmate

	Philosophy

		-
			A state of legal checkmate is created when an individual or group is in a situation
			where they are not in violation of the law, but where it is effectively impossible for
			them to proceed without being in violation of the law.

			The aspects of the law that are capable of generating states of legal checkmate are
			referred to as conditions of legal absurdity.
