Measure of Development

	Philosophy

		-
			The measure of development is a model which posits that the advancement of a society or
			civilization can be quantified by first quantifying how much they are immediately
			capable of in terms of the production of goods and services, both in terms of variety
			and quantity, and dividing the result by their population size, and then dividing that
			result by the labor required to produce said goods and services.
