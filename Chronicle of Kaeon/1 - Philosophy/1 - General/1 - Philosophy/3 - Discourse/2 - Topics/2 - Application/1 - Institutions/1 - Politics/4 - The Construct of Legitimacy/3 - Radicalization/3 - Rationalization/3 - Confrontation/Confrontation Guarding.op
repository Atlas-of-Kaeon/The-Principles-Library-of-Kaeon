Confrontation Guarding

	Philosophy

		-
			Confrontation guarding is the tendency for people to react with hostility to being
			confronted regarding their views which are considered wrong or taboo.

			It may have the effect of making them cling to their views even more strongly than
			before, even if they pretend to abandon them, and the effect may be magnified if the
			confrontation is aggressive.
