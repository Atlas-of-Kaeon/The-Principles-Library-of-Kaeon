The Social Homunculus Effect

		-
			The social homunculus effect is a metaphor for the tendency of people to assign
			significance to social and political phenomena in proportion to their visibility, which
			can often result in a skewed perception of the objective weight of said phenomena.

			A given instance of the social homunculus effect can be referred to as a social
			homunculus.
