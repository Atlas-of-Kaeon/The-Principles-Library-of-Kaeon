		JSON

			-
				ONE elements can be represented in JSON using ONE list form, where the elements
				are encoded as JSON lists and element content is encoded as JSON strings.

				ONE elements can be represented in JSON using JSON objects, where an object may
				contain a field with the alias "content", containing a string with the content of
				the element, and a field with the alias "children", containing a list, where each
				value represents a child of the element, with the order of said values
				corresponding to the order of said element's children.

				The former format can be called "JSON List ONE", and the latter format can be
				called "JSON Object ONE".

				An element with no children may be specified as JSON string, number, boolean, or
				null literal, with the printed form of each literal specifying the element's
				content. This format can be called "JSON Literal ONE".

				The child values of an element in either JSON List ONE or JSON Object ONE may be in
				any of the aforementioned formats.

				The use of either format can be called "JSON ONE".

				In certain APIs, a JavaScript-style object representing a JSON Object ONE element
				may have a field with the content "parent", which may either contain a reference to
				a value representing the parent element, or a null value indicating that it has no
				parent. This format can be called "JavaScript ONE", or "JS ONE" for short.

		XML

			Standard

				-
					ONE elements can be represented in XML with the tags "Element" and "Content",
					where letter case is irrelevant, in a format called "Standard XML ONE".

					An element tag represents a ONE element and may contain an indefinite number of
					other element tags and may also contain one content tag.

					A content tag must be the child of an element tag, and may contain a string
					representing the content of its parent, which if not present, indicates that
					its parent contains an empty string as its content.
				-

			General

				-
					ONE elements can be represented in XML using any XML document structure, in a
					format called "General XML ONE".
					
					In this format, an XML element is interpreted as a child of the ONE element
					represented by its parent XML element, or of the ONE root element if said XML
					element has no parent, and the content of said ONE element shall be the tag
					name of said XML element.

					An XML attribute is interpreted as a ONE element with a single child, where the
					alias of said attribute is the content of said element, and where the content
					of said attribute is the content of said child.

					An XML text node is interpreted as a child of the ONE element represented by
					its parent XML element, and the content of said ONE element shall be the text
					content of said text node.
