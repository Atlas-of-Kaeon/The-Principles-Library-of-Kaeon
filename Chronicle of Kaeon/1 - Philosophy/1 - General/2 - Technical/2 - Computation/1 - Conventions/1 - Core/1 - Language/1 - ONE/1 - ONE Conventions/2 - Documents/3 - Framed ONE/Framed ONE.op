Framed ONE

	Philosophy

		-
			Framed ONE is a variant of ONE where, for each terminating sequence which defines the
			bounds of a ONE element, a sequence of characters called the framing sequence is placed
			following said terminating sequence and either the next breaking sequence or the end of
			the document.

			The framing sequence shall consist of whitespace sufficient to match the length of the
			nesting sequence plus the length of the longest line in the content of the element to
			which it belongs, followed by the terminating sequence.

			The rectangle defined by the two terminating sequences that define the bounds of a
			given element, and the two terminating sequences of the corresponding framing
			sequences, shall constitute the frame of the element to which they belong.

			A document consisting entirely of framed ONE elements shall be called a framed ONE
			document.

	Principles

		Framed ONE Book

			-
				A framed ONE book is a modified standard Kaeon library book where all of the ONE
				documents within it are rendered in framed ONE.
			-

		Ornamentation

			-
				Textual and visual content may be placed outside the frames of framed ONE elements
				for ornamental renderings.

				A framed ONE document surrounded by such ornamentation is called a decorated ONE
				document.
			-

		Unconventional Styling

			-
				If a document in a framed ONE book is not intended to be machine readable via OCR,
				its contents may be formatted improperly to some extent so long as the intent
				remains clear.
