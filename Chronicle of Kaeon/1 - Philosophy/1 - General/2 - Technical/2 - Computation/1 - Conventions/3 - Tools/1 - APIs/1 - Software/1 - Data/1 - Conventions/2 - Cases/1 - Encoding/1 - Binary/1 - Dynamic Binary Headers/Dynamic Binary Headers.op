Dynamic Binary Headers

	Philosophy

		-
			Dynamic binary headers allow metadata in binary files to be specified using a standard
			that can scale to varying lengths.
		-

	Principles

		Structure

			-
				Dynamic binary headers shall occur at the beginning of a binary file, and their
				content, which itself shall be in trinary, shall be specified using "11" to
				represent "2", "10" to represent "1", and "01" to represent "0", and shall end with
				"00".

				Following a header may be another header, the main content of the file, or the end
				or the file. No more headers may be placed into the file following the beginning of
				the main content.
			-

		Count Header

			-
				A count header, which if present must be the first header in the file, shall
				specify, as a trinary number, the number of headers present in the file, not
				counting itself.
			-

		Sequence Headers

			-
				If a count header is present, the headers that follow it may be sequence headers,
				each of which specify, as a trinary number, the length of a sequence of bits in the
				main content.

				The sequences defined by the sequence headers shall start at the beginning of the
				main content and shall be adjacent to one another, ordered according to the order
				of their corresponding headers.
				
				Any bits that follow the last sequence in the main content may be used for another
				purpose, if it is not junk data.
			-

		Sequence Objects

			-
				A binary file separated into sequences using sequence headers may itself be
				separated into sequences called sub-sequences using sequence headers.

				Sub-sequences may be used as references to the sibling sequences of their parent.

				If being used this way, each subsequence should have a header defining itself as
				either a reference or as raw data. The header for a reference should be "0100", and
				the header for raw data should be "1000".

				The content following a reference header should be a binary number specifying the
				index of the sibling sequence being referenced, starting at zero, and the content
				following a raw data header should be raw data in binary.
