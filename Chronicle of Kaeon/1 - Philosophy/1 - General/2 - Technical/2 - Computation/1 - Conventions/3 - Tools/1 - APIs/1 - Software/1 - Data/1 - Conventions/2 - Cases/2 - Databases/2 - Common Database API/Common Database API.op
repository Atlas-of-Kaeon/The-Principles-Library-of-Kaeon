		Parameters

			Sources

				-
					The sources parameter is either a single value or a list of values that
					specify databases that the requests are directed at.

					Each of said values may either be a string specifying the database, or a list
					where the first element is said string and the second element, if present, is
					a list of lists where in each of said nested lists, the first element is a
					string specifying the name of a credential and the second is a string
					containing the value of a credential.
				-

			Requests

				-
					The requests parameter is either a single value or a list of values that
					constitute requests directed at the intended databases.
				-

			Type

				-
					The type parameter, which is optional, is a string that specifies the type of
					database the requests are intended for.

					If the type parameter is not present, the API may attempt to dynamically
					accommodate the request.
