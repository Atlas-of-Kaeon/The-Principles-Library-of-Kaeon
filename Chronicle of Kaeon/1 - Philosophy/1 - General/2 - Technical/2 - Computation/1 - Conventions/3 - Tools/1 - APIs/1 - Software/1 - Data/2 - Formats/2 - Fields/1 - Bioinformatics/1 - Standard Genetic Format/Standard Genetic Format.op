Standard Genetic Format

	Philosophy

		-
			The standard genetic format is a file format for encoding the genome of an organism.

		Structure

			Chunks

				-
					The standard genetic format is a binary format that uses sequence headers to
					separate its content into chunks.

					Each possible nucleotide base shall be assigned a unique numerical index,
					referred to as the base index, in a hierarchy.

					The first chunk shall be a header, referred to as the base order header, used
					to specify, as a trinary number, how many types of nucleotide bases are present
					in the sequenced DNA. This number shall be referred to as the base order.
					
					For each nucleotide base present in the DNA, one chunk, called a base index
					header, shall follow the first chunk, specifying the base index of the
					respective nucleotide base. The order in which a base index header is placed
					relative to the others, starting at zero, is referred to as its base reference.

					Each of the chunks that follow the base index headers, excluding the last one,
					shall specify the nucleotide sequence of a given DNA component of an organism's
					genome using a multistate binary sequence called a standard nucleotide
					sequence.

					The final chunk may specify, in any manner, any miscellaneous metadata about
					the sequenced DNA.

			Standard Nucleotide Sequence

				-
					A standard nucleotide sequence is a multistate binary sequence used to
					represent a sequence of nucleotides in a DNA molecule. It shall have an order
					equivalent to the specified base order.
					
					Each number specified in the sequence shall be the base reference of the base
					header for one of the nucleotide bases present in the sequenced DNA.

		Conventions

			Standard Base Indices

				Adenine

					-
						The standard base index for adenine is zero.
					-

				Cytosine

					-
						The standard base index for cytosine is one.
					-

				Guanine

					-
						The standard base index for guanine is two.
					-

				Thymine

					-
						The standard base index for thymine is three.
					-

				Uracil

					-
						The standard base index for uracil is four.

			Eukaryotic Conventions

				-
					The conventional format for representing the genome of a eukaryotic organism is
					to specify the nucleotide sequences for each of its chromosomes in order,
					followed by the nucleotide sequence of its mitochondria.
				-

			Abbreviation

				-
					The standard genetic format can be abbreviated as "SGF" and thus files written
					in it should have an "sgf" extension.
				-

			ONE

				-
					The standard genetic format has a human-readable ONE-based counterpart known as
					the ONE genetic format, which can be abbreviated as "OGF".

					A document in the ONE genetic format may have an indefinite number of elements,
					called sequence elements.

					Sequence elements must contain the name of the nucleotide sequence they
					represent, and may have an indefinite number of children, called nucleotide
					elements.

					Each nucleotide element corresponds to a given nucleotide, and they must be
					arranged in the order that they occur in the gene they represent.
					
					Nucleotide elements shall contain the base index of a base nucleotide, in
					decimal format, which shall define the nucleotides they represent.
