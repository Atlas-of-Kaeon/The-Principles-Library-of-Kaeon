Minimal API

	Philosophy

		-
			A minimal API is a service that receives http and https requests, and performs tasks
			and returns data based solely on the content of the request's URL.
		-

	Principles

		Default Header

			-
				By default, requests to minimal APIs should use GET headers, though effects of said
				requests may be anything.
			-

		Minimal API Wrapper

			-
				A minimal API wrapper is a utility that automatically handles tasks that require
				multiple minimal API calls.

				This may be necessary in cases involving encryption or where large amounts of data
				need to be exchanged.
