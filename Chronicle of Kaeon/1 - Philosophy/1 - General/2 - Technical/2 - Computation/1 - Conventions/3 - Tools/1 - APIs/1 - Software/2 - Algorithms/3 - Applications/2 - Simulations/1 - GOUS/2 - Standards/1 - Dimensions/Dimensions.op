Open Universe Dimensions

	Philosophy

		-
			This document specifies how the coordinate systems and entity properties defined in the
			open universe core shall be defined.
		-

	Principles

		Coordinates

			Universal Time

				-
					The universal time shall be defined in seconds.
				-

			General Coordinate System

				-
					Points on the axes of the general coordinate system shall be defined in light
					years.
				-

			Relative Coordinate Systems

				Standard Relative Coordinate System

					-
						The standard relative coordinate system is a relative coordinate system
						that defines points relative to a given cosmic entity by projecting a ray
						out from its center defined by a vector aligned with its tilt, and scaling
						it to a given number of meters.

						If the entity in question is a celestial entity, said point may be
						projected onto its surface, and then optionally modified from the resulting
						point.
					-

		Cosmic Entity Properties

			All

				Position

					-
						Dependent cosmic entities shall have their positions defined in meters, and
						independent cosmic entities shall have their positions defined in light
						years.
					-

				Tilt

					-
						Cosmic entity tilt shall be defined in radians on the x and z axes.
					-

			Cluster Entities

				Dimensions

					-
						Dependent cluster entities shall have their dimensions defined in meters,
						and independent cluster entities shall have their dimensions defined in
						light years.
					-

				Paths

					Types

						Points

							-
								A path used to define the form of a cluster entity may be defined
								using a sequence of points, with the path flowing from one point to
								the next in order.
								
								Each point shall have the width for the cluster entity at itself
								defined, with the width at all other points derived by
								interpolating between them.
							-

						Ring

							-
								A path used to define the form of a cluster entity may be defined
								using a ring, which shall be perfectly circular, with the radius of
								its center and its width, which shall be the same everywhere.
							-

						Spiral

							-
								A path used to define the form of a cluster entity may be defined
								using a spiral, which shall, from its position, spiral outwards,
								with its radius increasing at a specified rate per radian, and
								terminating after a specified number of radians.

								It shall have its width defined at its starting point and at its
								terminating point, and shall interpolate between them for all other
								points.
							-

					Coordinates

						-
							A path used to define a path entity shall have a starting point.

							The starting point for a points path is the first point.

							The starting point for a ring path is at zero radians relative to the z
							axis of its parent.

							The starting point for a spiral path is at the center of the spiral.

							The position of an entity within the defined cluster entity is defined
							by specifying a distance from the starting point along the path and
							by specifying the x and y coordinates of the child entity on a plane
							that intersects the path at that point.
						-

				Cloud

					-
						A cloud cluster entity may use the dimensions used to define a ring path to
						define said entity as a hollow sphere.

						The position of an entity within a cloud entity may be defined as a 3D
						cartesian point relative to its center.
					-

			Celestial Entities

				All

					Mass

						-
							Celestial entity mass shall be defined in kilograms.
						-

					Diameter

						-
							Celestial entity diameter shall be defined in meters.
						-

				Dependent

					Orbit

						Path

							-
								The orbital path of a dependent celestial entity shall have its
								tilt defined in radians on the x and z axes, and its dimensions
								specified in meters, with its length and the position of its
								length-wise center relative to the center of the parent entity on
								the z axis, as well as the position of its widest point relative to
								its length-wise center on the z axis and its width at said point.
							-

						Speed

							-
								The average orbital speed of a dependent celestial entity shall be
								defined in meters per second
							-

						Start

							-
								The starting position of a dependent celestial entity along its
								orbital path where the universal time is zero shall be defined in
								radians, projected from a unit circle to a point on the ellipse.
							-

					Rotation

						-
							The rotational speed of a celestial entity shall be defined in radians
							per second.
