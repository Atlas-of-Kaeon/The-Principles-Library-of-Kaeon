JSH Plugin

	Philosophy

		-
			A JSH plugin is a browser plugin that shall ensure that a conventional JSH package
			instance is running on the client machine for each port defined in its settings, unless
			other applications already occupy said ports.
		-

	Principles

		Security

			-
				Every time a user navigates to a page, the instance shall require the page to ask
				permission before said page shall be allowed to send any HTTP request to the ports
				defined in its settings.
			-

		Defaults

			-
				The default ports for the instance to initialize a server consist solely of the
				port 80.
