Open Universe Core

	Philosophy

			This document specifies the core principles of the general open universe standard.

	Principles

		Global Values

			Core Seed

				-
					The core seed is the number used to seed the algorithm responsible for
					generating the procedurally generated content of the simulation.

					If no core seed is specified, it shall be set to zero.
				-

			Universal Time

				-
					The universal time is the amount of time that has lapsed since the big bang
					relative to a hypothetical point in space where the rate at which time passes
					has remained constant.
				-

		Entities

			Types

				Independent Entities

					-
						An independent entity is generally defined as any entity that a human could
						escape the gravitational pull of by jumping.
					-

				Celestial Entities

					-
						A celestial entity is generally defined as any entity that a human could
						not escape the gravitational pull of by jumping.
					-

				Cluster Entities

					-
						Groups of entities that act as singular units shall be referred to as
						cluster entities.
					-

				Cosmic Entities

					-
						Cluster entities and celestial entities can collectively be referred to as
						cosmic entities.
					-

			Relations

				Parent-Child Relations

					-
						A cosmic entity that sits within a cluster entity or orbits a celestial
						entity shall be a child of the entity to which it is bound.
					-

				ID

					-
						All cosmic entities, save for the universe, shall have a unique numerical
						ID relative to their immediate siblings, and the universe shall have an ID
						of zero.
					-

				Dependent Cosmic Entities

					-
						A dependent cosmic entity is any cosmic entity that descends from a
						celestial entity via parent-child connections.

						All other cosmic entities shall
					-

			Properties

				All

					Position

						-
							The position of the center of a cosmic entity, save for the universe,
							shall be defined relative to its parent.
						-

					Tilt

						-
							Each cosmic entity, save for the universe, shall have an axis along
							which it is tilted relative to its parent.
						-

				Cluster Entities

					Dimensions

						-
							The dimensions of a cluster entity may either be defined as a point or
							a path.

							If it is defined as a point, it shall be spherical and must have its
							diameter defined.

							If it is defined as a path, it must have its width defined at each
							point on said path.
						-

				Celestial Entities

					All

						Mass

							-
								Each celestial entity shall have a mass property.
							-

						Diameter

							-
								Each celestial entity shall have a diameter property.
							-

					Dependent

						Orbit

							Path

								-
									Each dependent celestial entity shall have a tilted ellipse
									that defines the path of its orbit around its parent.
								-

							Speed

								-
									Each dependent celestial entity shall also have its average
									orbital speed defined.
								-

							Start

								-
									Each dependent celestial entity shall have the point along its
									orbital path, where it is located where no time has passed
									according to the universal time, defined.
								-

						Rotation

							-
								Each dependent celestial entity shall have the speed at which it
								rotates defined.
							-

		General Coordinate System

			-
				The general coordinate system shall be used to define the exact location of content
				within the simulation.

				It shall define the position of objects on a three dimensional cartesian coordinate
				system, with its origin set at the center of the resulting grid.
			-

		Relative Coordinate Systems

			-
				A relative coordinate system is a system that may be used to define the position of
				objects relative to a given entity.
			-

		Generation

			-
				After certain entities have been placed into the simulation manually, procedural
				content shall be generated according to the core seed.
				
				The positions of celestial entities within the simulation should be determined by
				the universal time value.
