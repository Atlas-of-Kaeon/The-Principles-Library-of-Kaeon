Kaeon Architecture

	Philosophy

		-
			Kaeon Architecture is a system for constructing modules in a manner that maximizes
			modularity and fault tolerance.

			A module designed using the Kaeon architecture is referred to as a Kaeon module.

	Principles

		Utilities

			-
				Utilities are functions and modules that are publicly available and statically
				accessible.
			-

		Processes

			-
				Processes are persistently running modules that serve solely to govern the calling
				of functions within utilities.
			-

		Network

			-
				A module designed using the Kaeon architecture is formed of a group of modules
				connected together in a Philosopher's Atlas.
			-

		Data

			-
				All data stored by a module designed using the Kaeon architecture should be stored
				in internal or external databases that are globally accessible to the utilities.
			-

		Layers

			-
				The network of a module designed using the Kaeon architecture shall be separated
				into two sections: the application layer for processing the internal logic of the
				module, and the interface layer for communicating with external modules.
			-

		Core

			-
				The network of a module designed using the Kaeon architecture may have a single
				module placed between the application layer and the interface layer of the network
				known as the core module, which if present shall serve as a reference point for the
				whole module.
