GPIO Pin Map

	Philosophy

		-
			A GPIO pin map is a convention used to organize the pins of a GPIO device so as to
			simplify the programming of them.

	Principles

		Map Types

			Output

				-
					All programmable output pins of a GPIO device shall be grouped together and
					labelled in order relative to each other based on their ordering when taking
					all pins into account, starting at zero. Said order shall be referred to as the
					output pin map.
				-

			Input

				-	
					All input pins shall themselves be grouped together in the same manner. Said
					order shall be referred to as the input pin map.
				-

			Dual

				-
					Optionally, all pins may, using the aforementioned ordering convention, be
					placed together in a single pin map referred to as a dual pin map, which may
					act as both the output pin map and the input pin map.
				-

		Pin Settings
	
			-
				The status of a pin may be set to false, indicating that it is generating no
				output, to true, indicating that it is on and set to high, or to a number between
				zero, exclusive, and one, inclusive, specifying an exact level of output.

				If a binary pin is assigned a number, its value will default to true.
			-

		Standard Microcontroller Serial Communication

			-
				The standard microcontroller serial communication is a convention used to specify
				how to control a microcontroller's functioning according to its pin map over USB
				communication.

				A microcontroller abiding by the standard shall be configured to receive signals
				in the form of binary sequences where each bit corresponds to the value to set a
				pin to on said device, where the index of the bit corresponds to the pin it maps to
				according to said device's input pin map.

				Whenever such a device receives such a signal, it shall be sent back a binary
				sequence where each bit corresponds to the current value of a pin on said device,
				where the index of the bit corresponds to the pin it maps to according to said
				device's output pin map.
