GHI Call Protocol

	Philosophy

		-
			An HTTP request made to a receptor module using the general hardware interface format
			shall use the POST method, and its body shall consist of a stringified receptor input
			format object.
			
			It shall return a stringified receptor output format object in the body of its
			response.

			For security and accessibility purposes, the server which receives the calls should
			have a static IP and should utilize HTTPS.
