GHI Sub-Modules

	Philosophy

		-
			GHI sub-modules are devices which are not directly accessible by the GHI, but which are
			controlled by devices that are directly accessible via the GHI.

			GHI sub-modules may be listed as their own devices and may have special high-level
			commands dedicated to them which allow for easier control than by manually programming
			their controller devices.
