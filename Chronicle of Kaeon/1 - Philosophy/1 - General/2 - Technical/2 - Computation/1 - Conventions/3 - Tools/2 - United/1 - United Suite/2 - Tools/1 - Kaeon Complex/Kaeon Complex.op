	Principles

		Command Structure

			-
				Kaeon Complex shall take as its first command line argument the name of the
				language it is to work with, and shall take the path to the main file of the
				program it is to compile or execute as its second argument.
				
				Whether it compiles or executes the program is dependent on the language specified.

				Every argument following the second shall serve as command line arguments for
				executed programs.

		Standard Distribution Method

			-
				By default, Kaeon Complex shall be accessible via npx.
