Is Command

	Philosophy
	
		-
			The is command command contains the content "Is Command". It must have a single child
			that returns a string.
			
			It will return true if the returned string would be interpreted as a command other than
			a literal, variable, or function call if it were the content of a Kaeon FUSION command.
