Variables

	Philosophy
	
		-
			The variables command contains the content "Variables". It may optionally have a child
			that returns a boolean value.
			
			It returns a list of all variable aliases stored in the state. If it has a child and
			the child returns false, then the list will only contain aliases from the local scope.
			If it has a child and the child returns true, then the list will only contain aliases
			from the global scope.
