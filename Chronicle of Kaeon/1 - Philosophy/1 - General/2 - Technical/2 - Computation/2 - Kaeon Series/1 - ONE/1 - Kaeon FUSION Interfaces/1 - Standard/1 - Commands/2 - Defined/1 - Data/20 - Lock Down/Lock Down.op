Lock Down

	Philosophy
	
		-
			The lock down command contains the content "Lock Down". It may have an indefinite
			number of children, where each of the string forms of the values they return are used
			to activate a given command.
			
			It permanently disables the commands activated by the string forms of the returned
			values.
