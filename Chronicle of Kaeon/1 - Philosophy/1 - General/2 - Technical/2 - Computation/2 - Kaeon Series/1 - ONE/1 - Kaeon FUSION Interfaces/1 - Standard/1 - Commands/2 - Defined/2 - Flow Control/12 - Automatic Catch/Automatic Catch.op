Automatic Catch

	Philosophy
	
		-
			The automatic catch command contains the content "Automatic Catch". It must have a
			single child that returns a boolean.
			
			If the returned boolean is true, exceptions thrown following the execution of the
			command will be automatically caught. If the returned boolean is false, exceptions
			thrown following the execution of the command will not be automatically caught.
