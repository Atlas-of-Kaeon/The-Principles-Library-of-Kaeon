Addresses

	Philosophy
	
		-
			The addresses command contains the content "Addresses". It may have one child that
			returns a string in the form of a domain name.
			
			If it has no children, it will return the IP addresses of the device that Kaeon FUSION
			is running on as a list. If it does have a child, it will return the IP addresses of
			the specified domain name as a list.
