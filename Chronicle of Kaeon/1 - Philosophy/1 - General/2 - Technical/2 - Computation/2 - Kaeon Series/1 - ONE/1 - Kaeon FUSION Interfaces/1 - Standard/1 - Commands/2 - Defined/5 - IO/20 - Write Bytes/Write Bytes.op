Write Bytes

	Philosophy

		-
			The write bytes command is a command with the content "Write Bytes". It shall either
			two or three children, the first of which returns an assembly dialect document, the
			second of which returns a string containing a file path, and the third of which, if
			present, returns an integer number greater than or equal to one.

			It writes the bytes specified by the returned assembly dialect document to the file
			specified by the returned path. If the returned number is present, it shall start
			writing the bytes to the file at the index specified by said number where indices start
			at one.
