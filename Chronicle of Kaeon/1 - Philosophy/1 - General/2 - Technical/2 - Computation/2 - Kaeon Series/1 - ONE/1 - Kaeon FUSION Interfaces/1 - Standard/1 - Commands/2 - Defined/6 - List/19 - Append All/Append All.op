Append All
	
	Philosophy
		
		-
			The append all command contains the content "Append All". It may have two or more
			children. Its first child will return a list, and every subsequent child will return a
			list.
			
			The contents of each returned list with the exception of the first list will, in the
			order their respective lists were returned, be appended to the first list.
