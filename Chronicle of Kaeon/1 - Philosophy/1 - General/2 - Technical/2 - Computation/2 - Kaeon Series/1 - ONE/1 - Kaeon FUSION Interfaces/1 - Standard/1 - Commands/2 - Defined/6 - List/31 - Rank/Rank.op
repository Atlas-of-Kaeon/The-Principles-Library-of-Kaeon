Rank

	Philosophy
	
		-
			The rank command contains the content "Rank". It must have a single child that returns
			a list.
			
			It will isolate every unique value in the list and place each unique value into a list
			with the other unique values that occur the same number of times as itself. It will
			then place each list into a new list in the order from the values that occur the least
			to the value that occur the most. It will then return the new list.
