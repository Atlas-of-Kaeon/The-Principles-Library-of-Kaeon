Append
	
	Philosophy
		
		-
			The append command contains the content "Append". It may have two or more children. Its
			first child will return a list, and every subsequent child will return an object.
			
			Each returned object will, in the order it was returned, be appended to the list
			returned by the first child. The list will then be returned.
