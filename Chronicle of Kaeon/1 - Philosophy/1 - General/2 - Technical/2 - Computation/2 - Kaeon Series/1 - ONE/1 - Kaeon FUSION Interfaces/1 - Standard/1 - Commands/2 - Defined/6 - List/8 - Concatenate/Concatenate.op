Concatenate
	
	Philosophy
		
		-
			The concatenate command contains the content "Concatenate". It may have an indefinite
			number of children, each of which returns a list.
			
			It will concatenate the content of each list into a single list, according to the order
			of the children that returned them, and return the list. If the first returned list was
			in the form of a string, the list will be returned in the form of a string, and
			returned in the form of a list otherwise.
