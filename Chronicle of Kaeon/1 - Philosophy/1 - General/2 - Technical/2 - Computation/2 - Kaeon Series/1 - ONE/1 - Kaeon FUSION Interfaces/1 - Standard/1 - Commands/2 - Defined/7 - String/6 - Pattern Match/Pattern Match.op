Pattern Match

	Philosophy
	
		-
			The pattern match command contains the content "Pattern Match". It has two children,
			the first of which returns a string and the second of which returns a string in the
			form of a regular expression.
			
			It will return true if the first string matches the regular expression defined by the
			second string, and will return false otherwise.
