Less or Equal
	
	Philosophy
		
		-
			The less or equal command contains the content "Less or Equal". It may have an
			indefinite number of children, each of which return a number.
			
			It will return true if the number returned by every child except for the last child is
			less than or equal to than the number returned by the following child, and return false
			otherwise.
