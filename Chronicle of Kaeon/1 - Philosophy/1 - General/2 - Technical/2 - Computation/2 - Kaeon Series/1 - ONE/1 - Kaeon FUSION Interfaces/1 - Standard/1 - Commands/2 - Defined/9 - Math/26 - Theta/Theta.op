Theta
	
	Philosophy
		
		-
			The theta command contains the content "Theta". It must have two children, each of
			which return a number.
			
			It returns the theta component, in radians, of the polar coordinate equivalent for the
			cartesian coordinate where the number returned by the first child is the x value and
			the number returned by the second child is the y value.
