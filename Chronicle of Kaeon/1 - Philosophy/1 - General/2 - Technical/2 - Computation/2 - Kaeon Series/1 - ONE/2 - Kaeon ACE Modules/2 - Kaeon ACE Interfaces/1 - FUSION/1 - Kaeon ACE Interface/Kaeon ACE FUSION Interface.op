Kaeon ACE FUSION Interface

	Philosophy

		-
			The Kaeon ACE FUSION interface is a Kaeon FUSION interface with the alias "Kaeon ACE"
			that, upon completion of the execution of the script into which it is incorporated,
			causes said script to be interpreted as a Kaeon ACE document where the Philosopher's
			Atlas that hosts the FUSION interpreter is repurposed to serve as a Kaeon ACE
			interface, with the core of the FUSION interpreter becoming the core of said interface.
