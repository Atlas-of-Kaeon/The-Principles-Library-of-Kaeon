	Philosophy

		-
			The ONE Suite API is an API that may be used for processing ONE, ONE+, and Kaeon FUSION
			in various languages, and for using the universal preprocessor.

			Functions

				Preprocess

					-
						The preprocess function shall take a string as an argument, and shall
						execute any universal preprocessor directives in said string, and shall
						return the resulting string.
					-

				Parse

					-
						The parse function shall take any ONE or ONE+ string as an argument and
						shall return the content of said string in ONE list form, and shall utilize
						the universal preprocessor when parsing.
					-

				Write

					-
						The write function shall take a list representing a ONE document in ONE
						list form, and shall return the content of the document as a ONE document
						string.
					-

				Process

					-
						The process function shall take a ONE document in either the form of a ONE+
						string which may have universal preprocessor directives or in ONE list form
						as its first argument, and may optionally take an object representing a
						saved state of a Kaeon FUSION interpreter, which may be an empty object.

						If it received an interpreter state as an argument, it shall load said
						state into a Kaeon FUSION interpreter, and if not shall load a default
						Kaeon FUSION interpreter, and then shall use said interpreter to process
						the received ONE document as Kaeon FUSION code.

						After running the Kaeon FUSION script, it shall return the return value of
						the Kaeon FUSION script.
