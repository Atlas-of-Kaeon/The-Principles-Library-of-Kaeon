Genesis Pod

	Philosophy

		-
			A genesis pod is a self sufficient device or set of devices that can create gametes
			with precise control over their genetics, either automatically or from any number of
			compatible genetic samples, create zygotes from gametes, and gestate said gametes into
			infant animals.

			-

				may optionally have the ability to operate on the animal and either macroscopic or
				microscopic scales in this state.

				tissue.
