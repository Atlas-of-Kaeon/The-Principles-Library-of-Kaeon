Statement Regarding Autonomous Nerve Synthesis

	Philosophy

		-
			Autonomous nerve synthesis is the process of artificially inducing the growth of new
			nervous tissue from existing nervous tissue, either to form new structures or to
			connect to existing structures.

			It may be a significantly more effective method at integrating nervous tissue into new
			environments than more crude methods of grafting.
