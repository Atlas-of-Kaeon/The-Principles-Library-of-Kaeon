	Philosophy

		-
			This document lists conventions intended to prevent the misuse of autonomous weaponry.

	Principles

		Authorization

			-
				Producers and customers of autonomous weapons should be cleared by the government
				to engage in said business, and the application of autonomous weapons should be
				strictly limited to military and law enforcement spaces.

				Any facility which produces autonomous weapons should be heavily guarded, and
				should have protocols to destroy the weapons in case of a breach. No computer
				system involved in the development of said weapons should have any connection,
				direct or indirect, to any external network, and should employ high security
				encryption standards.

				Any business or entity that attempts to produce autonomous weapons without the
				proper clearance should face severe sanctions.
			-

		Hardcoding

			-
				The intended behavior of autonomous weapons should be hardcoded into them at the
				hardware level by the producers according to the needs of the customers.

				This behavior should include a geographic area in which, and only in which, they
				are permitted to deliver their payloads.
			-

		Fail-safe

			-
				Any attempt to compromise or reverse engineer an autonomous weapon should cause it
				to self destruct, such that recovery and analysis of it is effectively impossible.

				This functionality should also trigger if communication with ground control is cut
				for a prolonged period of time, and ground control should also be able to trigger
				this function manually in the event of an emergency.

				If deemed necessary as a deterrent, the self-destruction process may release toxins
				sufficient to kill anyone who attempts to manually disassemble them.
