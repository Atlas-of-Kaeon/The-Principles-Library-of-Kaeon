Gap Resentment

	Philosophy

		-
			If one does not possess something that others have, they are likely to experience
			resentment over the matter in proportion to how difficult they believe it would be for
			them to attain said thing for themselves.

			It is possible to relieve resentment simply by revealing that the desired object is in
			fact easier to attain than the subject initially perceived it to be.
