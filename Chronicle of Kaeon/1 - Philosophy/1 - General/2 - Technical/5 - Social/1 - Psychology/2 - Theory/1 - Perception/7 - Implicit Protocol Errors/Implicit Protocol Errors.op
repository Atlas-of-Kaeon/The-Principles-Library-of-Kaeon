Implicit Protocol Errors

	Philosophy

		-
			In social contexts where the convection for communicating certain topics is through
			implicit cues rather than explicit statements, the possibility of miscommunications is
			dramatically increased.

			Furthermore, certain individuals may err towards either over-optimistic or
			over-pessimistic interpretations of said cues depending on their status within said
			social contexts.
