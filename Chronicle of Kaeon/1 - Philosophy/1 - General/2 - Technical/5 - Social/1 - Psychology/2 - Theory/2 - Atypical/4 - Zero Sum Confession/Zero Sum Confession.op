Zero Sum Confession

	Philosophy

		-
			A zero sum confession is a confession which, if made, would have stakes greater than a
			given individual could afford, or would conflict too much with their internal
			narrative, thus when faced with the choice of making a zero sum confession, many
			individuals will refuse to confess even when confronted with overwhelming evidence.
