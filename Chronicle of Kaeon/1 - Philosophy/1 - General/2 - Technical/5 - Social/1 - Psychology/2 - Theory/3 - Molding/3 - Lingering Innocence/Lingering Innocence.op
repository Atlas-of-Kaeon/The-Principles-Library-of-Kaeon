Lingering Innocence

	Philosophy

		-
			Lingering innocence refers to aspects of one's youthful naivete that persist into
			adulthood, which may be repressed in the subconscious, and can benefit the person in
			terms of creativity, optimism, and enjoyment of life, but can also damage them in terms
			of gullibility, and in terms of their ability to meet adult responsibilities.
