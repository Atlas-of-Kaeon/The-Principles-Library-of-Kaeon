	Philosophy

		-
			This document lays out a way in which free market capitalism may gradually evolve into
			autoism.
		-

	Principles

		Stage 1

			-
				The transition initiates in a state of free market capitalism.
			-

		Stage 2

			-
				Growing automation and wealth stratification forces an expansion of social safety
				nets, culminating in a universal basic income.
			-

		Stage 3

			-
				Automation continues to overtake more and more work until all labor necessary to
				sustain society is automated except for government and legal roles, at a point
				called the automation singularity.
			-

		Stage 4

			-
				Goods and services continue to cheapen until many of them stop charging for their
				purchase altogether, after which wealth gradually becomes irrelevant for practical
				purposes, and institutions such as money and class, among others, are in time
				rendered vestigial.
