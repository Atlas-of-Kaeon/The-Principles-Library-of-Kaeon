Xyro Infrastructure

	Philosophy

		-
			Xyro infrastructure is a combination of auto infrastructure systems designed to
			maintain an ideal world.
		-
	
	Principles

		Systems

			-
				Xyro infrastructure is composed of clean agricultural auto infrastructure, clean
				transportational auto infrastructure, clean architectural auto infrastructure,
				clean medical auto infrastructure, clean defense auto infrastructure, manufacturing
				auto infrastructure, and any support auto infrastructure necessary to support the
				aforementioned systems, as well as a dot net, and all of said systems are built on
				sustainable auto infrastructure.
			-

		Beneficiaries

			-
				All humans would be entitled to the full benefits of the Xyro infrastructure by
				default, with free and luxurious housing provided by the clean architectural auto
				infrastructure, and food and other utilities provided by delivery on demand for
				free. All humans would be given free XR computers as their means to interface with
				the system and free internet and cloud data storage would be provided by the dot
				net.
			-

		Space Program

			-
				Under the implementation of the Xyro infrastructure, a space program would be
				initiated with the primary goal of expanding humanity's presence in permanent and
				mobile settlements indefinitely across the universe, and it would also have the
				goal of preparing solutions to establish relations with alien life forms, as well
				as solutions to support the survival and revival of all sentient beings past any
				point where life would otherwise be unsustainable.
			-

		Laws

			-
				Under such a system, nation-states, currency, taxation, and warfare, among other
				things, may be rendered obsolete as we know them, and restraining orders enforced
				by the clean defense auto infrastructure may be the only necessary form of criminal
				justice.

				However, it may be necessary to maintain democratically elected bodies whose sole
				purpose is to ensure the proper operation of the machines, to resolve civil
				disputes in accordance with the Angaian Creed, and to manage community
				organization, and to maintain independent bodies to manage relations between the
				aforementioned bodies.

				Citizens would generally be under the authority of the governing bodies that have
				jurisdiction over the land in which they reside, but would be free to relocate at
				will unless in the midst of an emergency.

				It would be most ideal that a global declaration of rights and responsibilities
				defined in accordance with the Angaian Creed be unanimously agreed upon and
				universally enforced, which would ensure, among other things, the basic rights to
				life, liberty, and personal property within reason.
