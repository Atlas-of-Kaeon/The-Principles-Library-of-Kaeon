Paradox of Principle

	Philosophy

		-
			The paradox of principle is the principle that any ethical system will encounter
			situations where, of the choices available to a given agent, it equally supports more
			than one as the most valid answer, resulting in the agent being forced to inject their
			own subjectivity into the decision making process to choose one from among the valid
			options.
