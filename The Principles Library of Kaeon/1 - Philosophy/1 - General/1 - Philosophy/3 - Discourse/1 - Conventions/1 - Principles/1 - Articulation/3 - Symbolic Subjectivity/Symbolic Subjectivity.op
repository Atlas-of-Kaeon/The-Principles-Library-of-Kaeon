	Philosophy

		-
			Although objective reality exists independently of personal understanding, it must be
			rendered symbolically for people to engage with it, and thus symbolism and linguistics
			are the primary vectors through which personal and sociological interaction with
			objective reality can become corrupted with subjective bias.
