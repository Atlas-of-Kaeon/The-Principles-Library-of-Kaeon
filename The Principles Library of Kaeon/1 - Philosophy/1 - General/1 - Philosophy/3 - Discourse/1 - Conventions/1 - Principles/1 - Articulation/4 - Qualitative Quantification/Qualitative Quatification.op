Qualitative Quantification

	Philosophy

		-
			Qualitative quantification is the process of deducing the attributes of qualitative
			constructs relative to one another when relative measurements are feasible but absolute
			measurements are not.

			Qualitative quantification can also be called relative quantification, and
			non-qualitative quantification can be called absolute quantification.
