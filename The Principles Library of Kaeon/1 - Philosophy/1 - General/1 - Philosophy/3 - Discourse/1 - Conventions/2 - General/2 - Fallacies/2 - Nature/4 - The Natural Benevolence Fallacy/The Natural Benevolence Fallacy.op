		The Natural Purity Fallacy

			-
				The natural purity fallacy, or the natural simplicity fallacy, is closely related
				to the natural benevolence fallacy, and is the notion that natural things are pure
				or simple, when in fact, many natural objects and phenomena are extraordinarily
				complex.

				Naturally occurring biological objects and systems are arguably the most complex
				things in the universe by an enormous margin, vastly dwarfing anything manmade or
				inorganic in complexity.
