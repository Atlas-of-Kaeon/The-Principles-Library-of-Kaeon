Responsibility

	Philosophy

		-
			One's responsibility for dealing with a given problem can be defined as a qualitative
			composite deriving from the following factors: how guilty one is for causing said
			problem, how severe said problem is, how capable one is of resolving said problem, and
			the extent to which said individual is party to contracts mandating responsibility for
			said problem.
