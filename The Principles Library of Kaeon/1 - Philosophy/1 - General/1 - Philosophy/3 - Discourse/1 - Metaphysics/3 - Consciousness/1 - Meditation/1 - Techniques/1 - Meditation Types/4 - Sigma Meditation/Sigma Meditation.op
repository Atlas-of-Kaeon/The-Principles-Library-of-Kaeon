		Open Sigma Meditation

			-
				Open sigma meditation is a form of sigma meditation where one mentally pleads for
				assistance, thus opening themselves up to external, or seemingly external influence

				them.

				Sigma meditation can be reinforced by asserting that one's goals concern some
				higher purpose.
