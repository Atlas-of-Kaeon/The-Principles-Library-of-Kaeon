Conspiracy Theory Evaluation

	Philosophy

		-
			The general principle when assessing the possibility that a conspiracy theory is true
			is that the more a given conspiracy theory violates Occam's razor, that the simplest
			explanations tend to be the most accurate, the less likely it is to be true.

			Overall, the most important questions to ask are how much the conspiring party has to
			gain by engaging in the conspiracy, how much effort it would take for them to do it
			successfully, and how much effort it would take for them to cover it up.

	Principles

		The Skeptic Principle

			-
				The skeptic principle is that, though one should not necessarily disregard
				conspiracy theories, they should evaluate any evidence put forth in their defense
				with a grain of salt, carefully reviewing all other possible explanations before
				accepting anything, keeping in mind the sources of all the available information
				and the possible agendas and biases behind them.

		The Gateway Principle

			-
				The gateway principle is that one's ability to separate fact from fiction erodes
				the more they accept nonsensical fantasies as reality.
