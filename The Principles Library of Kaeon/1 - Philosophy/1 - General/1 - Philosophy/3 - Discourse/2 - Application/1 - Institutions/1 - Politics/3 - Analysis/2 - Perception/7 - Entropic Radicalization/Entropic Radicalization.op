Entropic Radicalization

	Philosophy

		-
			Entropic radicalization occurs when grassroots fringe ideas, born from common
			grievances, spread among isolated communities before making their way into mainstream
			politics, and from there spread into the rest of the public.

			In the course of this process, demagogues may emerge, building their platforms on such
			ideas and driving their application to unnatural extremes.
