The Cosmic Enemy

	Philosophy

		-
			The cosmic enemy is an abstract device that could in theory assist in overcoming one's
			innate sense of tribalism by projecting onto a single hypothetical entity immense power
			and a desire to destroy all life, who works by dividing people into tribes and by
			causing self destructive behavior among them, which if taken far enough, would climax
			in total global omnicide.
