Persecution Acceleration

	Philosophy

		-
			In an ideology that establishes some sort of human ideal and seeks to persecute anyone
			who lies outside said ideal, said ideal will likely narrow if said outliers are removed
			so as to include people who previously considered immune to said persecution, until
			eventually no one is safe and anyone left lives in a constant state of fear of falling
			victim to said persecution themselves.
