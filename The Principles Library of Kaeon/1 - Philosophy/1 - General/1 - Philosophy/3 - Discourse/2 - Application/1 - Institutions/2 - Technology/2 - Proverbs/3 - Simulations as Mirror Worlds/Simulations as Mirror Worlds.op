Simulations as Mirror Worlds

	Philosophy

		-
			Simulations can be thought of as worlds unto themselves, which may be entered and
			exited at will.

			Just as simulations can be used for entertainment and for training, they can also be
			used for conducting business and simply for living in.

			A single simulation may serve any number of the aforementioned purposes.
