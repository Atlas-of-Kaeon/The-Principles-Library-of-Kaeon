The Spinal Principle

	Philosophy

		-
			The spinal principle is that a strong creative or utilitarian work is ideally defined
			by an elegantly simple and minimalistic form, upon which layers of additional
			complexity may be stacked.

			It creative works, the principle lends to memorability, and in either case, to
			longevity.
