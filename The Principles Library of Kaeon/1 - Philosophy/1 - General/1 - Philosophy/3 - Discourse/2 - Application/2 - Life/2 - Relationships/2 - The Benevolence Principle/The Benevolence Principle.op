The Benevolence Principle

	Philosophy

		-
			The benevolence principle holds that the vast majority of people are fundamentally good
			so long as they have no extreme reason not to be, and that when people are bad it is
			usually because something in their life has gone horribly wrong.

			This is because, in general, to be a good person is common sense.
