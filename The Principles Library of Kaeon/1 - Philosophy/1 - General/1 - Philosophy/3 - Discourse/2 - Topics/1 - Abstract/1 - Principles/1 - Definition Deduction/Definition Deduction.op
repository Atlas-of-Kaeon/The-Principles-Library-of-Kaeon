	Principles

		Solutions

			Substitution

				-
					Performing definition deduction for a given concept by substitution consists of
					asking the question "what is said concept?" and replacing said concept with
					another word or phrase such that the replacement becomes the general
					definition of the concept.
				-

		Verification

			-
				The result of definition deduction for a given concept can be tested by seeing if
				anything acknowledged to be an instance of said concept does not match the
				definition, or if anything that is not an instance of said concept does match the
				definition.

				So long as no such cases can be asserted, the definition can be said to be valid.
