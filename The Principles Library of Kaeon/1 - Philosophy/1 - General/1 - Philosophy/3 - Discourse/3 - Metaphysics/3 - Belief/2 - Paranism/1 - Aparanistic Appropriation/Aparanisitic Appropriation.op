		Useful Irrationality

			-
				An irrational mindset may offer useful insights that someone who refuses to engage
				with irrationality to any degree may be too prideful to acknowledge.

				degree of comfort such that breaking their faith in it would cause severe and
				lasting emotional distress, it is better to allow them to keep their belief.
