Qualitative Composites

	Philosophy

		-
			A qualitative composite is an abstract quality that can be described as being composed
			of, or arising from, a certain set of other abstract concepts, to a degree dependent on
			the extent to which the latter concepts, which can be referred to as the factors of the
			former, are present, though in such a way that said degree can be relatively
			quantified, but not absolutely quantified.
