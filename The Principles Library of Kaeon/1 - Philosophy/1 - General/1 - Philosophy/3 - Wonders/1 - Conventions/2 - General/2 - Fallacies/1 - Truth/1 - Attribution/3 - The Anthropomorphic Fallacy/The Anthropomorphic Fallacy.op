The Anthropomorphic Fallacy

	Philosophy

		-
			The anthropomorphic fallacy is the tendency for people to perceive inanimate objects
			and abstract concepts as having human traits such as emotions or gender, as well as the
			tendency to assume such aspects of the human condition are inevitable and eternal.

			The reverse can also occur, where people are associated with objects and abstract
			concepts based on their human traits.
