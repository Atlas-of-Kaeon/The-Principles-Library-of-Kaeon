The Ethical-Disgust Fallacy

	Philosophy

		-
			The ethical-disgust fallacy occurs when one assumes that because something seems gross
			or taboo, that it is therefore unethical.

			This can be especially problematic when people associate something that bears the
			aesthetic of a certain fictional scenario with the ethics of said scenario without
			applying any critical thought to it.
