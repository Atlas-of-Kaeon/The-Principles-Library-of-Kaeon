Value Accountability

	Philosophy

		-
			Value accountability is a principle which holds that governing institutions and
			officials should be accountable to the governed primarily on the basis of quantifiable
			value delivered by the former to the latter, primarily in terms of direct wealth gain.

			This model frames the citizen as a shareholder of the polity, equal to all others in
			proportion to the population.
