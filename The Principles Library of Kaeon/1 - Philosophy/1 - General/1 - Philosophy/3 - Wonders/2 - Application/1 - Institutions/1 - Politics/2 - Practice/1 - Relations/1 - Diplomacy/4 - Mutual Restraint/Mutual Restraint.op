Mutual Restraint

	Philosophy

		-
			The doctrine of mutual restraint holds that one of the most secure defenses against a
			certain tactic being used against oneself is to establish a precedent wherein the use
			of said tactic is publicly affirmed as taboo, with said taboo being systematically and
			institutionally enforced for all parties, including and especially oneself.
