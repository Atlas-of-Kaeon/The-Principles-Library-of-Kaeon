Obligations of Service

	Philosophy

		-
			Regarding services provided in public or business contexts, individuals and
			institutions may freely choose whether or not to provide a given service, and may
			freely choose the nature and the content of the service, but may not discriminate in
			rendering said service or any otherwise accepted variation thereof to any potential
			customer except for reasons of safety and the viability of the service itself.
