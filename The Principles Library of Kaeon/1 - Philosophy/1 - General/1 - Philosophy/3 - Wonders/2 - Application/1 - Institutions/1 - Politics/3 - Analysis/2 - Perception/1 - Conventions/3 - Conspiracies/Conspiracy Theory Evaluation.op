Conspiracy Theory Evaluation

	Philosophy

		-
			The general principle when assessing the possibility that a conspiracy theory is true
			is that the more a given conspiracy theory violates Occam's razor, that the simplest
			explanations tend to be the most accurate, the less likely it is to be true.

			Overall, the most important questions to ask are how much the conspiring party has to
			gain by engaging in the conspiracy, how much effort it would take for them to do it
			successfully, and how much effort it would take for them to cover it up.

	Principles

		Definitions

			Conspiracy Theories

				-
					Conspiracy theories are narratives that diverge highly from their mainstream
					equivalents and which allege intentional coverups as the reason for the
					differences.
				-

			Coverup Theories

				-
					To distinuish conspiracy theories which are somewhat plausible to a reasonbable
					person, they may be referred to as "coverup theories" to distance themselves
					from the term "conspiracy theory".

					Conversely, conspiracy theories which are both vastly beyond the realm of
					reasonable plausibility and which would have disatrous consequences if taken
					seriously can be referred to as "crimes against reality", though this is not to
					suggest that believing in them should actually be prosecuted.

		Conventions

			The Skeptic Principle

				-
					The skeptic principle is that, though one should not necessarily disregard
					conspiracy theories, they should evaluate any evidence put forth in their 
					efense with a grain of salt, carefully reviewing all other possible
					explanations before accepting anything, keeping in mind the sources of all the
					available information and the possible agendas and biases behind them.
				-

			The Gateway Principle

				-
					The gateway principle is that one's ability to separate fact from fiction erodes
					the more they accept nonsensical fantasies as reality.
