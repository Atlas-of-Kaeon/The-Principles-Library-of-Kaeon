Convert Syndrome

	Philosophy

		-
			Convert syndrome is the tendency for converts to a given philosophy or way of living to
			be more devoted and engaged with it than long-time adherents of it.

			Convert syndrome may increase in intensity the more investment is required from the
			conversion process or from the ideology being converted to.
