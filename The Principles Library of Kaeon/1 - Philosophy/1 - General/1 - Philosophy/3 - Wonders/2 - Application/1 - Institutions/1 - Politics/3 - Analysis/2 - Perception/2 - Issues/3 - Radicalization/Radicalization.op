Radicalization

	Philosophy

		-
			Any discussion of an ideology will generally, in the absence of opposition, tend to
			gravitate towards the extremes of said ideology, and shall become more aggressive
			towards outside opinions in the process.

			An ideology can therefore be judged by projecting the likely consequences of its
			extreme application.
