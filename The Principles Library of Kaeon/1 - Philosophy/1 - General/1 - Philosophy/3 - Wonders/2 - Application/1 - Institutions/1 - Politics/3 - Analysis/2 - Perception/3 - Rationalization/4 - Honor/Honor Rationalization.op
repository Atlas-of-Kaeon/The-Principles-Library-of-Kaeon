Honor Rationalization

	Philosophy

		-
			When one attempts to rationalize a behavior or sentiment that victimizes another party,
			they may attempt to assert that from the violence committed against the victim emerges
			a sort of transcendent honor that brings virtue to the violence and outweighs the harm
			done to the victim.
