The Seeker Principle

	Philosophy

		-
			The seeker principle states that if entities that would normally be characterized as
			paranisitc do exist, then they are in fact aparanistic, and thus if some benefit is
			contingent upon knowledge of them, efforts should be made to verify their existence via
			aparanistic means.
