Meta Patterns

	Philosophy

		-
			Meta patterns are patterns derivable from high-level views or abstractions of a
			process, from which information may be derived about the state of said process at
			varying levels of detail.

			Meta patterns, may, in some cases, be used as input if applied to a system by an
			external agent.
