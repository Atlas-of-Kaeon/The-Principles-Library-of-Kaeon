Nullification

	Philosophy

		-
			For a given number 'x' and a given function 'f', and the nullifying function 'n':

				x = f(n(x))
		-

	Principles

		Dead Weight

			-
				If n consists solely of multiplying x by a constant 'c', then c is referred to as a
				dead weight.

				A function f for which a dead weight may be applied for the purpose of
				nullification is referred to as dead-compatible.
