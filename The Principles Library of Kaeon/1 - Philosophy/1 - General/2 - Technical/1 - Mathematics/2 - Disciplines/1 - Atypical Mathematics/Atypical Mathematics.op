Atypical Mathematics

	Philosophy

		-
			Atypical mathematics refers to mathematical disciplines and practices that either work
			outside the fundamental axioms of math or expand them to their limit by introducing new
			axioms that may or may not conflict with the fundamental axioms.

			Thus, any form of mathematics that operates strictly within the confines of the
			fundamental axioms of math is referred to as typical mathematics.
