Local Polygon

	Philosophy

		-
			In a given N dimensional space containing an indefinite set of N dimensional points,
			a given point's local polygon could be said to have the N nearest points to said point
			acting as its vertices.
			
			If there are N or fewer than N points in said space, then all of the available points
			shall be used.

			If multiple points close enough to define the local polygon are the same distance from
			the central point, all of said points shall be used.

	Principles

		Polygon Space

			-
				A polygon space is a N-dimensional rectangular prism space defined by the extremes
				of the values of vertices of a given polygon.
			-

		Polygon Interpolation

			-
				Polygon interpolation derives an N dimensional value from an N-1 dimensional point
				being projected onto an N dimensional polygon.
