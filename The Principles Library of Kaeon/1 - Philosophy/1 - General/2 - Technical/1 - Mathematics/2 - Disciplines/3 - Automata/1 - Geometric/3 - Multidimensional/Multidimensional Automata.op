Multidimensional Automata

	Philosophy

		-
			Multidimensional automata is a form of geometric automata in which the space in which
			the simulation takes place operates in at least three dimensions.

	Principles

		Subdimensional Automata

			-
				Subdimensional automata is a form of geometric automata in which the space in which
				the space in which the simulation takes place operates in either zero or one
				dimensions.
			-

		Varying Dimensional Automata

			-
				Varying dimensional automata is a form of geometric automata in which the
				simulation takes place in a varying dimensional space.
