Functional Superpositions

	Philosophy

		-
			Mathematical superpositions may be rendered as functions which take a number as an
			input, said number, referred to as the arbiter number, representing the arbitrary
			element in a resolution of the superposition, thereby determining the output.

			Arbiter numbers should be normalized to values between zero and one, inclusive.
