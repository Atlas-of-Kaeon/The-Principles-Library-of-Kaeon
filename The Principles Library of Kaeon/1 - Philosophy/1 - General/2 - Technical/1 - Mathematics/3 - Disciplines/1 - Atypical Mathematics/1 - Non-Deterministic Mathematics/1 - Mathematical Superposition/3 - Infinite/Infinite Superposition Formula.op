Infinite Superposition Formula

	Philosophy

		-
			Given a function f, such that f(x) oscillates covering at least all real numbers
			between zero and one, inclusive, towards infinity, an infinite superposition can be
			defined as infinity * f(infinity).

			Trigonometric functions such as sine and cosine are candidates for f.
