Kaeon FUSION Standard Conventions

	Philosophy
	
		-
			The Kaeon FUSION Standard Conventions establish standards that Kaeon FUSION
			implementations are expected to support.
		-
	
	Principles
		
		String Forms

			-
				All values returned by Kaeon FUSION commands must be convertible to strings.
				
				When a value is converted to a string, said string is referred to as the value's
				string form.
			-

		Command Priority
			
			-
				Certain Kaeon FUSION commands may hold priority over others, meaning that commands
				every time Kaeon FUSION trickles down at a command, the command's children will be
				rearranged first based on their priority and then based on their current order.
			-
	
		Module Aliases
		
			-
				Kaeon FUSION interfaces may be referenced through aliases as opposed to their file
				paths. The letter case of said aliases is irrelevant.
			-
	
		Return Value
		
			-
				Whenever a Kaeon FUSION command returns a value, said value may be designated as
				the return value, which will be returned to Kaeon FUSION's host environment after
				it terminates.
				
				There may only be one return value at a time.
			-
		
		Workspace
		
			-
				The workspace refers to the directories that Kaeon FUSION will import resources
				from. The directories that compose the workspace must be arranged into a hierarchy.
				
				When attempting to locate a given resource, Kaeon FUSION will search each directory
				in the order of their priorities until either the resource is found or there are no
				more directories to search.
				
				By default, the workspace will consist of the local directory, the root directory,
				and the internet, but said directories may be added to or removed from the
				workspace.
