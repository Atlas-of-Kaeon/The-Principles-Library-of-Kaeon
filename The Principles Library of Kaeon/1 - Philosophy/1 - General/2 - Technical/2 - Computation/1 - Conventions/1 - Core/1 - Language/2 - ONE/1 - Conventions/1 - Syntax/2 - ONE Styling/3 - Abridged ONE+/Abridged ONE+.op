Abridged ONE+

	Philosophy

		-
			Abridged ONE+ is any variant of ONE+ which waives certain syntactic rules in cases
			where it is not meant to be parsed digitally.

			Generally, this may involve waiving the distinction between types of brackets and
			quotes, or omitting the presence of certain tokens if the structure of the content is
			sufficiently obvious.
