Universal Preprocessor Assembler

	Philosophy

		-
			The universal preprocessor may be used to produce binary data by running it such that a
			directive, if it does not return a value of null, may return either a string or a byte
			array.

			In the latter case, the universal preprocessor shall stop and the output of the process
			shall be said byte array.
