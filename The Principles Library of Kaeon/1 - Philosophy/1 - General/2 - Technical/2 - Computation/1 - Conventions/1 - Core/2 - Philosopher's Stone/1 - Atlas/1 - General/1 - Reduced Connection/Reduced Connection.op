Reduced Connection

	Philosophy

		-
			A reduced connection is a type of connection in a Philosopher's Atlas.

			If a given module may only access another by traversing through a reduced connection,
			any argument passed from the former module to the latter module must be converted to a
			string before being passed to the latter module. Likewise, any value returned by the
			latter module must be converted into a string before being returned to the former
			module.
