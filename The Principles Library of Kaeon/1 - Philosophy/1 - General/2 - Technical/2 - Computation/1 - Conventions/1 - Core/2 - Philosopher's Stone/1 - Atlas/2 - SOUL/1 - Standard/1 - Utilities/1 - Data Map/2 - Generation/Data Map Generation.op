Data Map Generation

	Philosophy

		-
			Data map generation is any process in which a given data map and a vector of any length
			containing numbers between zero and one, inclusive, may be used to generate an output
			number between zero and one, inclusive, assuming said vector is a hypothetical input in
			a hypothetical input-output pair within said data map and said output number was the
			corresponding output in the input-output pair.
