	Philosophy

			This document specifies conventions for SOUL entities.

	Principles

		Atlas

			-
				A SOUL entity atlas is a SOUL entity implemented as or as part of a philosopher's
				atlas.
			-

		Cluster

			-
				A SOUL entity cluster is a group of SOUL entities that for all intents and purposes
				function together as a single SOUL entity.
			-

		Organs

			Philosophy

				-
					SOUL entity organs are modules that interact with SOUL entities.

					They may either be internal, meaning they are part of the SOUL entity itself,
					or external, meaning they interface with the SOUL entity through its input and
					output channels.
				-

			Principles

				Internal

					Pulse

						-
							A pulse is an internal SOUL entity organ that manages an internal event
							loop where upon each iteration other internal SOUL entity organs,
							called pulse modules, may send text through the output channels.
						-

					Record

						-
							A record is an internal SOUL entity organ that stores records of the
							text inputs received, text outputs sent, and numerical inputs received
							by the SOUL entity it belongs to along with the time they were sent or
							received.
						-

					Pulse Modules

						Starter

							-
								A starter is a pulse module that produces randomized output to
								send through the output channel when insufficient data is
								available within whatever records are present.
							-

						Core

							-
								A core is a pulse module that produces output to send through the
								output channel based on the contents of whatever records are
								present when said contents are sufficient.
							-

				External

					Manager

						-
							A manager is an external SOUL entity organ that allows a user to modify
							the state of a SOUL entity, to record the state of a SOUL entity and
							export it to text, to start, pause, or stop the activity of a SOUL
							entity, or to spawn and destroy SOUL entities.
						-

					Breeder

						-
							A breeder is a module that can take the serialized state of a SOUL
							entity and mutate it in order to emulate breeding.
