Axis Directory

	Philosophy

		-
			An axis directory is a directory used by a web server to store publicly accessible
			content.
		-

	Principles

		Conventions

			Alias Metadata

				-
					The alias metadata format may be applied to files in axis directories.
					
					By default, files in axis directories act as publicly accessible static
					content, though metadata segments in their file names may change this.

					Metadata segments used on such files are case insensitive.
				-

			Overlay

				-
					All axis directories used by a given web server shall be virtually overlaid
					using folder overlay, the resulting directory being referred to as the axis
					directory of the server.
				-

			Routing

				-
					The subdirectories of a URL shall specify a path within the axis directory of
					the server at which the desired resource may be found, with the MIME type set
					according to the file extension, unless altered by metadata segments.
					
					For the file name, only the ID sequence is necessary for any file without
					metadata segments.

					If no file name is specified for a folder in which a file with the ID sequence
					"index" is present, said file shall be retrieved.

					If multiple files matching the specified path are located, they shall be sorted
					alphabetically, and the first in the resulting order shall be retrieved.

					The server may have a default redirect set for a 404 error. If no such redirect
					is set, the server shall return a plain text message reading "404: Not Found".
