Conventional Shadow Host

	Philosophy

		-
			A conventional shadow host is a shadow host which may be instructed to integrate
			external JSON interfaces as shadow host interfaces via a URL argument with the alias
			"use", which contains a JSON array of strings, each of which specifies the path to one
			of said interfaces.
