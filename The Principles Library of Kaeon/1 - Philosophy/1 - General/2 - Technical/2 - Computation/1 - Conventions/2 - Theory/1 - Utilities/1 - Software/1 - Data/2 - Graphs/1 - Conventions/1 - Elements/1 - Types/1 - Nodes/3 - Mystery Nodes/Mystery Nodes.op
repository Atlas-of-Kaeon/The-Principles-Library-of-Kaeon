Mystery Nodes

	Philosophy

		-
			Mystery Nodes are nodes on a graph that act as stand-ins for a sub-graph of the graph
			to which it belongs.

			If said sub-graph can be accessed, the mystery node is referred to as open, whereas if
			said sub-graph cannot be accessed, the mystery node is referred to as closed.
