Entangled Elements

	Philosophy

		-
			Entangled elements are sets of graph elements which share static properties, meaning
			that altering said static properties for one of them alters it for all of them.

			Perfectly entangled elements are those for which all properties are static, effectively
			being shallow copies of one another.
