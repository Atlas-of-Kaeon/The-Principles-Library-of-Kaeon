Cluster List

	Philosophy

		-
			A cluster list is a list encoded as an ordered map, allowing duplicate keys, where each
			value is mapped to a number denoting its quantity such that it may be interpreted as a
			contiguous list where each of said values constitutes a subsection of the interpreted
			list containing the respective quantities of said values.

			A set cluster list is a cluster list where there are no duplicate values in its map
			form.
