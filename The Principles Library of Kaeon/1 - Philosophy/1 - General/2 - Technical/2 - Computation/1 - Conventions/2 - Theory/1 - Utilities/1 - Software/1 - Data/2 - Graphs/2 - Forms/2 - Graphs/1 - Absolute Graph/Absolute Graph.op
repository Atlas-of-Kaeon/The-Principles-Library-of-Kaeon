Absolute Graph

	Philosophy

		-
			An absolute graph is a graph where all nodes are connected to all other nodes and to
			themselves.

			An absolute graph where all nodes are connected by singular bidirectional connections
			is called a single absolute graph, and an absolute graph where all nodes are connected
			by dual unidirectional connections is called a dual absolute graph.

			The number of nodes in an absolute graph is called its degree.
