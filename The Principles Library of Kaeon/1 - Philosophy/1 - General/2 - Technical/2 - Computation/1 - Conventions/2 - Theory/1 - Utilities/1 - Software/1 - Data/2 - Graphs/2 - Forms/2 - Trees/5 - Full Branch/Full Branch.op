Full Branch

	Philosophy

		-
			A full branch is a list derived from a tree by tracing a path from its root node to a
			given leaf node.
			
			Assuming the leaf nodes of a tree can be ordered, so can the full branches derived from
			said tree. The ordered or unordered set of full branches derivable from a given tree
			can be called its tree bundle.
