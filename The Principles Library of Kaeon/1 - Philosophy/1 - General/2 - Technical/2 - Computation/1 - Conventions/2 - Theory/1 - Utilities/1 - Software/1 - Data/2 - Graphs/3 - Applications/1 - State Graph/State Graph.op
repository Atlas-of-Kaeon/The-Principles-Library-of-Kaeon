State Graph

	Philosophy

		-
			A state graph is a directed acyclic graph where the nodes contain the historic states
			of a given system, and the connections specifying that the system transitioned from the
			state at their origin to the state at their end, as well as any additional metadata
			regarding the context of the transition.

			A complete state graph contains all of the historic states of the system it represents,
			whereas a partial state graph does not.
