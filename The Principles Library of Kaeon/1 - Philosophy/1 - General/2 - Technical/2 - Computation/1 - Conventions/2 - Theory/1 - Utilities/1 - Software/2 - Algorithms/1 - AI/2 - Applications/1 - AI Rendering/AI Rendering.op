AI Rendering

	Philosophy

		-
			AI Rendering is the act of rendering scene geometry through a machine learning model
			either instead of through a graphics processor or before or after running it through a
			graphics processor.

	Principles

		Prudent Rendering

			-
				Prudent rendering is a process where a renderer for a pre-rendered scene determines
				which sets of frames repeat exactly or can be derived from a single frame and thus
				avoids rendering certain frames unnecessarily.
			-

		Prudent Playback

			-
				Prudent playback is when frames that repeat exactly in a sequence are stored only
				once, and the playback sequence itself is stored as a sequence of references to
				said frames.
