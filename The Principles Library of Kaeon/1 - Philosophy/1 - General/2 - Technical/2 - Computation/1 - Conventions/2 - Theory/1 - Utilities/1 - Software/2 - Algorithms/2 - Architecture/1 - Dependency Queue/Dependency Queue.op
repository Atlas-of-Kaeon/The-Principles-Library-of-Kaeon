Dependency Queue

	Philosophy

		-
			A dependency queue is a queue of dependencies fulfilling the same function within a
			given system, such that if one dependency in said queue fails, the system may attempt
			to use the next dependency in said queue, with the first dependency in said queue being
			used first.
