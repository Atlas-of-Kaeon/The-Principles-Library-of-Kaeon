Sub-Engine

	Philosophy

		-
			A sub-engine is a toolset or framework designed to facilitate a specific task or
			process within a more generalized toolset or framework that the sub-engine is built on
			top of.

			As sub-engines may be built on other sub-engines, the depth at which a sub-engine is
			nested within a tree of an engine and its sub-engines, referred to as an engine tree,
			may be referred to as its order.
