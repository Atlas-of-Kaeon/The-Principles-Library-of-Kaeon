Little Code Solution

	Philosophy

		-
			A little code solution is a software development platform that provides the ease of use
			provided by low-code and no-code platforms through plain text files alone.

			As such, the text file formats used by little code solutions should be easy to
			understand for non-technical audiences.

	Principles

		Little Code Adapter

			-
				A little code adapter is a plain text file format designed to emulate the
				functionality of an existing low-code or no-code platform through a little code
				solution, such that applications written in either may be seamlessly converted from
				one format to the other.
