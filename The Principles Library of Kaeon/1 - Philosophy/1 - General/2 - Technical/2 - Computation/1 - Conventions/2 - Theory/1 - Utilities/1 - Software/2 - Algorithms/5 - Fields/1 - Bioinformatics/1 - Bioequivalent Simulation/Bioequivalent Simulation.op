Bioequivalent Simulation

	Philosophy

		-
			A bioequivalent simulation (BES) is a virtual simulation of an organic system.

			A bioequivalent simulation may be assigned a numerical degree indicating the extent to
			which it simulates its subject, from a high level abstraction to a full biochemical
			simulation.
