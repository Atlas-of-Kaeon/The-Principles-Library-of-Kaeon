Turing Test Subversion

	Philosophy

		-
			When performing the Turing test on an artificial intelligence, one should routinely try
			to derail the interaction with nonsensical tangents and outbursts to see whether the AI
			seems aware of the absurdity of the diversions.

		Void Answer Fallacy

			-
				One flaw in many current generation AI systems is that by nature they must provide
				a response to a prompt, and thus will sooner give a wrong answer than no answer.
				
				This flaw can be exploited by forcing a conversation to continue past the point
				where it should otherwise stop, revealing the system's lack of true understanding
				and allowing the user to subvert protocols in the system's training.
