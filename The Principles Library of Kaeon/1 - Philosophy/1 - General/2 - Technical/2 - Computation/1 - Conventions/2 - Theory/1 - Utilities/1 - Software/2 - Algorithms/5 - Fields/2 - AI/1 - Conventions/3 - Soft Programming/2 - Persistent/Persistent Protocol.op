	Philosophy

		-
			A prompt protocol for initiating a continuous, real-time process in which an AI system
			responds to a constant input stream is referred to as a persistent protocol.

			A persistent protocol may utilize multiple models and model contexts, may initiate
			interactions with its environment, and may take into account cycle counts and real time
			passage.
