Corrective AI

	Philosophy

		-
			Corrective AI is the use of AI models to correct the output of other AI models or human
			work.
			
			This may enable multiple highly specialized models to be trained independently of each
			other and of more general purpose models, such that they may supplement each other
			without requiring any of them to be retrained.
