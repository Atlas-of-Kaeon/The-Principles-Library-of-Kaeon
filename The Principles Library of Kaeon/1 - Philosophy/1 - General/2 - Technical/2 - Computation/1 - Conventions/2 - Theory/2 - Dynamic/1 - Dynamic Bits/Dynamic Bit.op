Dynamic Bit

	Philosophy

		-
			A dynamic bit is a value that can be used as a bit in a virtual circuit.

			Dynamic bits may be of any type, and can be interpreted, either alone or in groups, to
			either produce a new value of any type or to produce a boolean value. Any operation
			used to do this must do so deterministically.
