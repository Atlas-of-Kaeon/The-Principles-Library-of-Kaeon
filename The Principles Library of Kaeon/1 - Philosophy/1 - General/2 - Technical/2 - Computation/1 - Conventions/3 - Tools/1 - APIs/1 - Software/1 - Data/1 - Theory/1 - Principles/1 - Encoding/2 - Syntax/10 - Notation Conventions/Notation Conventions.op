Notation Conventions

	Philosophy

		-
			Ideally, any system of notation should, in either its standard form or a variant
			thereof, be renderable in plain text using the character set common to keyboards in the
			region of its target audience, and in such a way that it is easily parsed by both human
			readers and digital parsers.
