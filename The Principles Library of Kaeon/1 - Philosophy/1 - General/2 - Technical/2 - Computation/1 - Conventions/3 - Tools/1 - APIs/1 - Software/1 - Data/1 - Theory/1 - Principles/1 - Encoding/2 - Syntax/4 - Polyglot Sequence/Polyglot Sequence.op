Polyglot Sequence

	Philosophy

		-
			A polyglot sequence is a string that constitutes valid code in more than one language.

			For a given set of languages, a polyglot sequence that operates the same way in each of
			said languages is referred to as convergent, and one that does not is referred to as
			divergent.
