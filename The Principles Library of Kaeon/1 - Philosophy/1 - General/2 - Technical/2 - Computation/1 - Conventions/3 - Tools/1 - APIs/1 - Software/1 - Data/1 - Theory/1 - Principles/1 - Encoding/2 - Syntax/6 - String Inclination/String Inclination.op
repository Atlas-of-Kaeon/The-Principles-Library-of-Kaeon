String Inclination

	Philosophy

		-
			The inclination of a given string refers to whether the first character of a string
			which is not punctuation or whitespace hails from a script that read left to right,
			rendering the inclination of said string as left, or from a script that reads right to
			left, rendering said the inclination of said string as right.
