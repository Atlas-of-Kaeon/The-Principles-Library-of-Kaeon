Readability Levels

	Philosophy

		-
			The readability level of a file format is level 1 ("render-only") if the raw content of
			the file cannot be as plain text, level 2 ("render-favored") if the raw content of
			the file is readable as plain text but lacking in some fundamental way relative to a
			rendering of said file, and level 3 ("render-optional") is the file is readable as
			plain text and is not lacking in any way relative to a rendering of said file.
