		Relational Database Implementation

			-
				A ONE database can be emulated using a single relational database table wherein
				every record represents an element, and where each record has five columns.

				The ID column, of type integer serial, specifies a unique ID for each element,
				where said ID is greater than one, and serves as the identifying column.

				The content column, of type string or text, specifies the string content of each
				element.

				The parent column, of type integer, specifies the ID of each element's parent
				element, and if the element has no parent, it shall contain zero.

				The index column, of type integer, specifies the index of each element parent among
				its parent's children starting at one, and if the element has no parent, it shall
				contain zero.

				The metadata column, of type string or text, specifies additional metadata
				regarding each element.

				Additionally, the database may be set up such that the data is spread across
				multiple tables, in which case information about the relationships between said
				tables shall be encoded within the content of the metadata column, and a single
				table within the database shall serve as the root or master table.
