Collection States

	Philosophy

		-
			A collection state refers to the internal state of a system, which may be referred to
			as a collection process, in which a series of distinct entities, which may be called
			collection entities, are maintained.

			The serialization of a collection state may be referred to as a collection document,
			and collection documents may be used to either initiate or update a collection process.
