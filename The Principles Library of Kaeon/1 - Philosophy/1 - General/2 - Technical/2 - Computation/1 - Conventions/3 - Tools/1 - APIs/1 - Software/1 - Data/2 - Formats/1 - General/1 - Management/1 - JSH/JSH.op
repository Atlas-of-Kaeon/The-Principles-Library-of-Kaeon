JSH

	Philosophy

		-
			JSH, which stands for JavaScript Shell, is a JSON format used for relaying command line
			instructions to devices.
		-

	Principles

		Conventions

			Communication

				Protocol

					-
						Calls made to devices using JSH should use POST requests sent over HTTPS.
					-

				Password

					-
						A JSH password is a credential required in a JSH call by a JSH server in
						order for said call to be processed.

						A JSH password may or may not be set at any given time.
					-

			Operations

				Modules

					-
						JSH modules are JSON schemas governing messages sent to and from certain
						applications on targeted systems alongside explicit commands via JSH.

						Each JSH module shall have a name, a request schema, and a response schema.

						A JSH application may run in restricted mode, in which command line
						instructions are prohibited, and only JSH modules are permitted.
					-

				Processes

					-
						A JSH process is a process which was either initiated via a JSH call, or
						which has otherwise granted permission to a JSH server to access it.
						
						Each active JSH process shall have a unique numerical ID.

		Format

			Request

				-
					The JSH request format is the JSON object format governing calls made to JSH
					servers. An object following the JSH request format is referred to as a JSH
					request object.

					A JSH request object may have any of the following fields: a field with the
					alias "commands", a field with the alias "processes", a field with the alias
					"modules", a field with the alias "password", and a field with the alias
					"newPassword".

					The commands field, if present, shall contain a list of objects, where each
					object shall have a field with the alias "command", containing a string
					specifying a command to be executed on the targeted device, and may optionally
					have a field with the alias "location", containing a string specifying the path
					to execute said command from.

					The processes field, if present, shall contain a list of objects, where each
					object shall have a field with the alias "id", containing a string specifying
					the numerical ID of an active JSH process, and may optionally have a field with
					the alias "input", containing a string to be sent to said process via command
					line input, as well as a field with the alias "terminate", which shall contain
					a boolean that, if true, shall cause said process to terminate.

					The modules field, if present, shall contain a list of objects, each of which
					shall have a field with the alias "module", containing a string specifying the
					name of a JSH module, and a field with the alias "request", containing an
					object in the request schema of said module.

					The password field, if present, shall contain a string specifying the current
					password of the JSH server. If said password is not provided as required when a
					password is set, the call shall not be processed.

					The newPassword field, if present, shall contain either a string, which shall
					change the password to said string, or shall contain a null value, which shall
					disable the password requirement.
				-

			Response

				-
					The JSH response format is the JSON object format governing calls made to JSH
					servers. An object following the JSH response format is referred to as a JSH
					response object.

					A JSH response object may have any of the following fields: a field with the
					alias "commands", and a field with the alias "modules".

					The commands field, if present, shall contain a list of objects for each active
					JSH process, where each object shall have a field with the alias "command",
					containing a string specifying the command which spawned said process, a field
					with the alias "location", containing a string specifying the path from which
					said process is running, a field with the alias "id", containing a string
					specifying the numerical ID of said process, and a field with the alias "log",
					containing a string specifying the output logged to the terminal by said
					process since the last JSH call.

					The modules field, if present, shall contain a list of objects for each JSH
					module operated by the JSH server, where each object shall have a field with
					the alias "module", containing a string specifying the name of a JSH module,
					and a field with the alias "response", containing an object in the response
					schema of said module, specifying the current state of said module.
