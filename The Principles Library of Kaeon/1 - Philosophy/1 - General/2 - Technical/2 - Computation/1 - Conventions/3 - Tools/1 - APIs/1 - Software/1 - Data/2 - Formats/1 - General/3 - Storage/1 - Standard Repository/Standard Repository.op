Standard Repository

	Philosophy

		-
			The standard repository is a convention for project repositories.
			
			Under the convention, project repositories should contain one folder sharing the name
			of the repository, in which all of the project contents are kept. Alongside said
			folder, there may also be a license file and a readme file.
