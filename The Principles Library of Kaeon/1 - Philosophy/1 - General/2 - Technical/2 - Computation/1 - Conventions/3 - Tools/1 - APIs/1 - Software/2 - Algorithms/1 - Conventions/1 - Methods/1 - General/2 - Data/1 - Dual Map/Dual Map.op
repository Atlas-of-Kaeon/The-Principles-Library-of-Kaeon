Dual Map

	Philosophy

		-
			A dual map is a key-value map where each value may act as the key to access its key as
			a value, returning a list of keys if multiple keys have the same value.

			Using a value as the key for a key or set of keys is called reverse access, and should
			be implemented to allow for O(1) execution time.
