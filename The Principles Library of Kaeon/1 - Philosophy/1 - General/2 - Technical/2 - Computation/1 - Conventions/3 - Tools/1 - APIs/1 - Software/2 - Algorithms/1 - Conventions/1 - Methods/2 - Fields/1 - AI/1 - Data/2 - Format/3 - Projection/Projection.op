Dimensional Projection Training

	Philosophy

		-
			Dimensional projection training is the process of simplifying datasets used to train AI
			models by taking multi-dimensional data points within them and projecting them to lower
			dimensional vectors.

			If said data points are projected to scalars, then the process may be referred to as
			scalar projection training.
