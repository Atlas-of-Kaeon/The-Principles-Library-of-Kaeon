Retroscaled Transforms

	Philosophy

		-
			Retroscaled transforms are transforms of sequential data where data more relevant to
			earlier points in said sequence is transformed to a greater degree than data more
			relevant to later points in said sequence.

			Retroscaled transforms can be used in generative AI to help it retain awareness of the
			earliest states in a given context despite having limited input capacity.
