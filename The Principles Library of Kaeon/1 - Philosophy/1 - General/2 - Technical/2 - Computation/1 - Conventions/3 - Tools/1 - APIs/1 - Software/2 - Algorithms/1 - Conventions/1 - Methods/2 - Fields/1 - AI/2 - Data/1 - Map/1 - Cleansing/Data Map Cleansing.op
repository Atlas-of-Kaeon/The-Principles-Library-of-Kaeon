Data Map Cleansing

	Philosophy

		-
			Data map cleansing is a process in which for a given data map, for all sets of points
			with matching input vectors, all are removed from the data map save for the most
			recently added point in each of said sets.

			A data map that has had data map cleansing applied to it is referred to as a cleansed
			data map.
