Neural Network Refactoring

	Philosophy

		-
			Neural network refactoring is the act of altering the structure of a neural network to
			either increase or decrease its complexity while preventing it from producing a
			different output for any given input.

			Alternatively, to alter the structure of a neural network while allowing for a minimal
			amount of alteration in its output for any given input is referred to as neural network
			pseudorefactoring.
