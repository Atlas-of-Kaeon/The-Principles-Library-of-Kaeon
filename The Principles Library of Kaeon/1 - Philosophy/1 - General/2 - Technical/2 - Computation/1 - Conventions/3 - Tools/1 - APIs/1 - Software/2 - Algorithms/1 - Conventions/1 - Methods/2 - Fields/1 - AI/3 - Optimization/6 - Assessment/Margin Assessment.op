Margin Assessment

	Philosophy

		-
			Margin assessment is an assessment method in which the output of a process is judged on
			similarity to expected output rather than on precisely matching the expected output.

			A method of calculating the similarity of an actual output and an expected output is
			referred to as a margin convention.

			Assessment that relies only on exact matches is referred to as precision testing.
