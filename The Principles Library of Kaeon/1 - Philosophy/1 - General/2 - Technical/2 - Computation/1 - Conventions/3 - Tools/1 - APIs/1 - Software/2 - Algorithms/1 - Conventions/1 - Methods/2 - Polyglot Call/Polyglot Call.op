			executes an operation in another, and returns the result to whatever it was called
			from.

	Principles

		Types

			Command

				-
					A command polyglot call takes a string specifying a terminal command, executes
					it, and returns the contents of stdout upon its completion.
				-

			Compile

				-
					A compile polyglot call takes a string specifying the code for a program
					written in a different language, and may optionally take a list of string
					arguments for said program.

					It dynamically interprets or compiles said code, runs the resulting program
					with the provided arguments if there are any, and then returns the contents of
					stdout upon its completion.
