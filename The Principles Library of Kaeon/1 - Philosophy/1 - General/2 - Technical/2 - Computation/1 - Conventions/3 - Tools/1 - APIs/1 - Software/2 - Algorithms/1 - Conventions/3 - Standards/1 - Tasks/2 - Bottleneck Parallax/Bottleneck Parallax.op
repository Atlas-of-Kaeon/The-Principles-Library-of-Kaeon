Bottleneck Parallax

	Philosophy

		-
			When multiple processes are iterating on shared threads, processes that take less time
			to execute may iterate multiple times to make up for time lost to more intensive
			processes which act as bottlenecks on said threads, according to an ideal tick rate for
			each process running on said threads.

			This process can be called bottleneck parallax.
