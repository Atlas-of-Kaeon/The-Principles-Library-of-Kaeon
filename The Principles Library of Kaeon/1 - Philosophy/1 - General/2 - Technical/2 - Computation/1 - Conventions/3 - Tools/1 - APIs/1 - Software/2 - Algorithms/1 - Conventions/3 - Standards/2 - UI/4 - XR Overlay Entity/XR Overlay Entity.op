XR Overlay Entity

	Philosophy

		-
			An XR overlay entity is a virtual entity that directly corresponds to a physical
			entity, which may be used to take the place of said physical entity in a cross reality
			simulation if said physical entity is absent, and to act as a digital twin of said
			entity for other purposes as needed.
