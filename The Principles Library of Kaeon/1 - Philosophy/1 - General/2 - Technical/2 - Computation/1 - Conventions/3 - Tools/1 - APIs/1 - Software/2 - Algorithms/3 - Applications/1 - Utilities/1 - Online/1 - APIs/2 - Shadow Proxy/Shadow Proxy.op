Shadow Proxy

	Philosophy

		-
			A shadow proxy is a CORS proxy that allows users to specify all aspects of an HTTP
			call to send as well as any modification to make to its response solely through its
			URL.

			It shall accept said URLs as GET requests and shall not require any specific headers.
		-

	Principles

		Standard Format

			-
				The standard format for a shadow proxy URL requires no subdomains and contains the
				URL argument "request", and may optionally contain the URL argument "response".

				The request argument shall specify the request to be sent in raw HTTP format.

				The response argument, if present, shall specify a JSON array containing a list of
				JSON objects specifying modifications to be made to the response.
				
				Each of said objects shall have a "type" field containing a string specifying the
				type of modification to be performed, and may optionally have a "data" field, which
				may have any content.

				The URL argument aliases and the content of the "type" field in the response
				modification objects are case insensitive.

		Standard Response Modifications

			Set Header

				-
					The set header modification shall have the type "Set Header", and its data
					field shall contain a string specifying a raw HTTP header.
					
					It shall either add said header to the response or overwrite it.
				-

			Encode

				-
					The encode modification shall have the type "Encode", and shall have no data
					field.
					
					It shall modify the string of the body to be JavaScript code that writes the
					original body string as a string to a global reference.
				-

		Restrictions

			-
				The proxy should not permit recursive requests to itself.
