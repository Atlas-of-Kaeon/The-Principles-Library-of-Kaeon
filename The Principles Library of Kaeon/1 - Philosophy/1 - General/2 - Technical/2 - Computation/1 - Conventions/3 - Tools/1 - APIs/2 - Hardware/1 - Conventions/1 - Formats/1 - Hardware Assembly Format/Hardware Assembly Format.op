				the following elements: an element with the content "Hardware", and an element with
				the content "Software", and an element with the content "Notes".
			-

		Hardware

			-
				The hardware element shall have a child with the content "Components", and may also
				have a child with the content "Connections".
			-

		Hardware Components

			-
				The components element in the hardware section shall have a child for each physical
				component of the assembly specified by the document.
				
				The content of each child of the components element shall be its numerical index
				within its parent, starting at one. Each of said children shall have a child
				specifying the type of the component it corresponds to, referred to as a name

				The connections element may have a child for any of the connections between the
				various devices within the assembly specified by the document.

				Each of said children, called a connection element, shall specify a connection
				between two of the components listed under the components element of the hardware
				section by their indexes as specified by their content, written starting with the
				index of the first component, followed by the string " to ", followed by the index
				of the second component.

				Each connection element may have a child with content specifying additional
				information about the connection.
			-

		Software

			-
				The software element may have a child with the content "Components", and may also
				have a child with the content "Files".
			-

		Software Components

			-
				The components element in the software section may have any children specifying
				information regarding the software installed on the assembly specified by the
				document.
			-

		Files

			-
				The files element may have a child for any file installed on the assembly specified
				by the document. Each of said children shall be called a file element.

				A file element's content shall specify the purpose of the file.
