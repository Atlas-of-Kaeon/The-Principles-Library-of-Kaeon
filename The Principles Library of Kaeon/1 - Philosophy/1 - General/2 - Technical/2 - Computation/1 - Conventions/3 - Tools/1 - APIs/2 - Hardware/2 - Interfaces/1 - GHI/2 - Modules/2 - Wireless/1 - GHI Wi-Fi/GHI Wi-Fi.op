GHI Wi-Fi

	Philosophy

		-
			GHI Wi-Fi is a convention used to relay information regarding Wi-Fi communication
			through the GHI.
		-

	Principles

		Type

			-
				The type of Wi-Fi modules shall be specified as "wifi" in the receptor output
				format.
			-

		Branch Formats

			Output

				-
					The branch data output format of a Wi-Fi device shall either be an object
					containing a field with the alias "credentials", and may optionally have a
					field with the alias "data".

					The credentials field shall contain an object. Said object shall have a field
					with the alias "ssid", containing a string specifying the SSID of a Wi-Fi
					network, and may optionally have the fields "password", containing a string
					specifying the password of said Wi-Fi network, "host", containing a string
					specifying a host IP to direct communication to over said Wi-Fi network, and
					"port", containing a number specifying a host port to direct communication to
					over said Wi-Fi network.

					If the data field is not present, the device shall act as a Wi-Fi router using
					the specified SSID and password.

					If the data field is present, it shall contain a string which shall be passed
					to the Wi-Fi endpoint with the specified SSID and password at the specified
					host IP and port. If either the host IP or host port are not specified, they
					shall be set to default values.
				-

			Input

				-
					The branch data input format of a Wi-Fi device is a list of objects
					representing any messages it received from external devices over its Wi-Fi
					connection since the last query for said input.

					Each of said objects shall contain two fields, a field with the alias "time",
					containing a number specifying the time in seconds that the message was
					received, and a field with the alias "data", containing a string specifying the
					message that was received.
