GHI Raspberry Pi

	Philosophy

		-
			GHI Raspberry Pi is a convention that specifies how Raspberry Pi computers ought to
			operate under the GHI.

			The convention specifies, among other things, the devices available to Raspberry Pis
			operating as receptor modules, along with the numerical IDs of said devices.

		Notes

			-
				A Raspberry Pi must have its Wi-Fi access point disabled in order for calls to its
				Wi-Fi module to function, unless it is integrated into a setup with more than one
				Wi-Fi channel.
