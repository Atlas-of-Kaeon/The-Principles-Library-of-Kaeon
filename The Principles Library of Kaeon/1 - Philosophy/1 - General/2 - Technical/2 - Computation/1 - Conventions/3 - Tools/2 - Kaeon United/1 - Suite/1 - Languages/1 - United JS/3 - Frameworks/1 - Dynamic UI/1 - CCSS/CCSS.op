CCSS

	Philosophy

		-
			Cross Cascading Style Sheet, or CCSS, is an HTML and CSS convention that extends both
			HTML and CSS such that all HTML attributes and CSS properties become interchangeable,
			allowing HTML attributes to be applied to elements as CSS properties, and CSS
			properties to be applied to elements as HTML attributes.

			If there is a conflict with the alias of a given attribute or property, the default
			interpretation of said alias shall take priority.
