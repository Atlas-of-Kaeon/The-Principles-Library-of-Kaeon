		-

	Principles

		Requests

			-
				A United Query Language request takes the form of a JSON object.
				
				Said object must have a field with the alias "operation", and may optionally have
				fields with the aliases "location" and "type".

				The operation field specifies the database operation to perform. Its value may
				either be a JSON object specifying the operation in a format designed for the
				United Query Language, or a string specifying the operation in the format that the
				target database natively accepts.

				The location field, if present, shall contain a string specifying the URL of the
				target database.

				The type field, if present, shall specify the type of database that the target
				database is.

				If the location and type fields are not present, their values shall be implicitly
				assumed.

				Executing the request shall return a JSON object or array, containing a field with
				the alias "data", which contains a JSON object specifying any data returned, and a
				field with the alias "error", which shall contain a null value if there was no
				error and shall contain a string specifying the error that occurred if there was
				one.
