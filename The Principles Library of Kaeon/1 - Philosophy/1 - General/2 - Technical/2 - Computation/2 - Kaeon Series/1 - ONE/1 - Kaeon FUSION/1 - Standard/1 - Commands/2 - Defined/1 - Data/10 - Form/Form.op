Form

	Philosophy
	
		-
			The form command contains the content "Form". It must have a single child that may
			return any object.
			
			It will return the string "Boolean" if the string form of the returned object matches a
			boolean value, the string "Number" if the string form of the returned object matches a
			numerical value, and the string "String" if the string form of the returned object does
			not match a boolean or a numerical value.
