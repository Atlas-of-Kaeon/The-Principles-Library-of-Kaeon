Listen

	Philosophy
	
		-
			The listen command contains the content "Listen". It may have an indefinite number of
			children, each of which return a list.
			
			If the interpreter receives packets from its host environment, their contents will be
			appended to any lists that at any point were passed to a listen command through said
			command's children.
