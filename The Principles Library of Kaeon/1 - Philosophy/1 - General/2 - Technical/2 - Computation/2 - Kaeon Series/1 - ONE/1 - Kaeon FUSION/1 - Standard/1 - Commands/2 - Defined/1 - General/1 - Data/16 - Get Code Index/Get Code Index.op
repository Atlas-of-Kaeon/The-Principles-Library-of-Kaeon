Get Code Index

	Philosophy
	
		-
			The get code index command contains the content "Get Code Index".
			
			It creates a list, and then starting from the command that called it, adds the index of
			said command to the beginning of said list, and trickles up to said command's parent
			until it reaches the root. It then returns the generated list.
