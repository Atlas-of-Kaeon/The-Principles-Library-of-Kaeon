Enable

	Philosophy
	
		-
			The enable command contains the content "Enable". It may have an indefinite number of
			children, where each of the string forms of the values they return are used to activate
			a given command.
			
			It re-enables the commands activated by the string forms of the returned values that
			have been disabled by the disable command.
