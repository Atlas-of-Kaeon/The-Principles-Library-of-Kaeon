Call
	
	Philosophy
		
		-
			The call command contains the content "Call".
			
			It sends the host environment of Kaeon FUSION a packet containing all of the objects
			returned by its children. The operation that is then performed and the value that the
			command returns are dependent on the implementation of the host environment and on the
			interfaces currently in use.
