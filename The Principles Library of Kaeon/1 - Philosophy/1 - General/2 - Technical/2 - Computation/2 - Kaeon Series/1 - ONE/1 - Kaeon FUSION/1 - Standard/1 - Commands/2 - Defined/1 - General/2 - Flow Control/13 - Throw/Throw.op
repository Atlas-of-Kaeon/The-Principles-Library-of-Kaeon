Throw
	
	Philosophy
		
		-
			The throw command contains the content "Throw". It may have one or two children, one of
			which is a boolean and the other of which is a string.
			
			If the boolean argument is not present, or if it is true, it will throw an exception,
			which, if the string argument is present, shall contain said string as its message,
			preventing any subsequent commands from executing until the exception is caught.
