Retrieve

	Philosophy
	
		-
			The retrieve command contains the content "Retrieve". It may have an indefinite number
			of children.
			
			It will generate a value that is either the value returned by its first child if
			exactly one value was returned to it, or a list of all of the values returned to it
			otherwise. If its parent command has content and would otherwise return a null value,
			it will instead return the generated value.
