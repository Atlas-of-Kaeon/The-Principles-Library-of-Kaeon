Catch
	
	Philosophy
		
		-
			The catch command contains the content "Catch".
			
			Unless an exception was thrown by a previous command, it will not trickle down. If it
			does trickle down, it will catch any exception thrown by a previous command as it does
			so, and will return true, returning false otherwise.
