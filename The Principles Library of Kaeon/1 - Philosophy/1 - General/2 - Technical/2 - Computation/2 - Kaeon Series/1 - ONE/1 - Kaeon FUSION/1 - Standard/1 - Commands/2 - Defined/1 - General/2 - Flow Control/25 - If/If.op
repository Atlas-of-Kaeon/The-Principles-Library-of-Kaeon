If

	Philosophy
	
		-
			The if command contains the content "If" and has two children, the first of which
			returns a boolean, and the second of which returns a ONE element in ONE list form.
			
			If the value returned by the first child is true, it shall execute the returned ONE
			element as Kaeon FUSION code.
