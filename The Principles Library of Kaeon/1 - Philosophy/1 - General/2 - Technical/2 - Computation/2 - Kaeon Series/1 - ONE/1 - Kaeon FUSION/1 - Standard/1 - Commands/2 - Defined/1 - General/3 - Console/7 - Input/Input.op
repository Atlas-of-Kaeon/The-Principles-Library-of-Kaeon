Input
	
	Philosophy
		
		-
			The input command contains the content "Input". It may have an indefinite number of
			children.
			
			If it has no children, it will return the next value returned by standard in. If it
			does have children, it will print the values returned by each of its children to the
			console, prompt the user for input and then return the string that was entered by the
			user.
