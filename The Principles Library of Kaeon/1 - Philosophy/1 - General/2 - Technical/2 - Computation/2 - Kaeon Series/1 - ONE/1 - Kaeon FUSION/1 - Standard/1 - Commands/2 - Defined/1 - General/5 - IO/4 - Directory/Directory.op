Directory

	Philosophy
	
		-
			The directory command contains the content "Directory". It has one child that returns a
			string in the form of a directory path.
			
			It will return a list containing two lists, the first of which contains the names of
			all of the directories within the returned directory and the second of which contains
			the names of all of the files within the returned directory.
