Cut
	
	Philosophy
		
		-
			The cut command contains the content "Cut". It will have two children, the first of
			which returns a list, and the second of which returns an object.
			
			It will split the list into several sublists based on the specified object and return
			the sublists as a list. If the list is in the form of a string and the object's string
			form is in the form of a regular expression, the string will be split based on said
			regular expression.
