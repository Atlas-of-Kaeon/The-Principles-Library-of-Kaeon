			The convert sequence command contains the content "Convert Sequence". It will have one
			child that returns either a list or a string.
			
			If its child returns a list, it will append each element in the list in order to a
			string and return the string.
			
			If its child returns a string, it will append each character in the string in order to
			a list and return the list.
