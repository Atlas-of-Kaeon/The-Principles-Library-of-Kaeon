Tokenize

	Philosophy
	
		-
			The tokenize command contains the content "Tokenize". It will have at least one child,
			the first of which returns a list.
			
			It will split the list into several sublists with sublists being formed from each
			sub-sequence of the list that matches the object returned by the children following the
			first child and each sub-sequence that occurs between the aforementioned sub-sequences.
			Said sub-sequences will then be returned as a list.
