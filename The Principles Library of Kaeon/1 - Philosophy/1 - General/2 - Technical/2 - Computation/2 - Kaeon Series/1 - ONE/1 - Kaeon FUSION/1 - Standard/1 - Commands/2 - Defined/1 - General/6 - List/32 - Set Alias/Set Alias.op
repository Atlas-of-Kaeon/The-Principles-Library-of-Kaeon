		-
			The set alias command contains the content "Set Alias". It has three children, the
			first of which returns a list, the second of which returns a number corresponding to an
			index within said list, and the third of which returns a string.

			It sets the alias of the element in the returned list specified by the returned number
			to the returned string.
