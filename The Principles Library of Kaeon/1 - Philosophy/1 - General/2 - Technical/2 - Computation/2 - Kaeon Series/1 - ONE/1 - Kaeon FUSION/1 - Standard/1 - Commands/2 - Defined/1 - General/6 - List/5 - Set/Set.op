Set
	
	Philosophy
		
		-
			The Set command contains the content "Set". It has three children, the first of which
			returns a list, the second of which returns an integer, and the third of which returns
			an object.
			
			It will set the value in the list returned by the first child at the index specified by
			the integer returned by the second child to the object returned by the third child. The
			list will then be returned.
