Insert
	
	Philosophy
		
		-
			The insert command contains the content "Insert". It must have at least three children,
			the first of which returns a list, the second of which returns an integer, and every
			subsequent child returning an object.
			
			It will insert the objects returned by every child past the second child in the order
			they were returned into the list returned by the first child at the index specified by
			the integer returned by the second child. The list will then be returned.
