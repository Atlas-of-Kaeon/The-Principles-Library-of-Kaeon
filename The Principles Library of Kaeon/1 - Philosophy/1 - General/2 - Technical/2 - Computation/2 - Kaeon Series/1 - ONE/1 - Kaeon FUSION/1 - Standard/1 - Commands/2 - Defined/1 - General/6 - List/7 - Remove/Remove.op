Remove
	
	Philosophy
		
		-
			The remove command contains the content "Remove". It has two children, the first of
			which returns a list, and the second of which returns an integer.
			
			It will remove the object in the list returned by the first child at the index
			specified by the integer returned by the second child. If the list is in the form of a
			string, it will return the list, and will return the removed object otherwise.
