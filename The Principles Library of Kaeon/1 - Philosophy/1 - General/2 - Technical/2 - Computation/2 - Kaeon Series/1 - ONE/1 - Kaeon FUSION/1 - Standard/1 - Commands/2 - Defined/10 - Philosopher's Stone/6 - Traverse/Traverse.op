Traverse

	Philosophy

		-
			The traverse command is a command with the content "Traverse". It has two children, the
			first of which shall return a list containing the state of a Philosopher's Atlas, and
			the second of which may return any value.

			It performs a traversal of the returned Philosopher's Atlas starting at the value
			returned by the second child, and returns a list of all values traversed across during
			said traversal.
