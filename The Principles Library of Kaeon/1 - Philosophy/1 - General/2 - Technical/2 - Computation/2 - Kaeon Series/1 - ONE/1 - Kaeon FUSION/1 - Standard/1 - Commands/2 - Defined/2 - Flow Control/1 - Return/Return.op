Return
	
	Philosophy
		
		-
			The return command contains the content "Return", and may have an indefinite number of
			children.
			
			It prevents any subsequent commands in the script or function from which it is called
			from executing. If it has no children, it will return a null value. If it has one
			child, it will return the value returned by its child. If it has more than one child,
			it will return all of the values returned by its children in a list. It will set Kaeon
			FUSION's return value to whatever it returned.
