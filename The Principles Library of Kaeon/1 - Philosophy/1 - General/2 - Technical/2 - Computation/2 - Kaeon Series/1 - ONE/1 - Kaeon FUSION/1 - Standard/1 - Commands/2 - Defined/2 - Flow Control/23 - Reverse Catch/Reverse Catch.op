Reverse Catch

	Philosophy
	
		-
			The reverse catch command contains the content "Reverse Catch".
			
			Unless an exception was thrown by a previous command, it will not trickle down. If it
			does trickle down, commands within its scope will be executed despite the exception
			that triggered it, but said exception will not be caught by the reverse catch command.
