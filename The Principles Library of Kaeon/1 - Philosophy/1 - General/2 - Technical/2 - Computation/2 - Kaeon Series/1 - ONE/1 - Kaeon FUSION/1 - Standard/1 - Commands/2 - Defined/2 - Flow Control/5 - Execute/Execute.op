Execute
	
	Philosophy
		
		-
			The execute command contains the content "Execute", and may have an indefinite number
			of children, each of which return a list representing a ONE element in ONE list form.
			
			It will interpret each returned list as a ONE element and execute said elements in
			order as Kaeon FUSION code within the namespace of the script or function it was called
			from.
