File Size

	Philosophy
	
		-
			The file size command contains the content "File Size". Its first child returns a
			string containing a file or directory path, and it may optionally have a second child
			that returns a boolean.
			
			If it has a second child and said child returns true, it will return the space the file
			or directory at the returned path takes up on disk. Otherwise, it will return the size
			of the file or directory.
