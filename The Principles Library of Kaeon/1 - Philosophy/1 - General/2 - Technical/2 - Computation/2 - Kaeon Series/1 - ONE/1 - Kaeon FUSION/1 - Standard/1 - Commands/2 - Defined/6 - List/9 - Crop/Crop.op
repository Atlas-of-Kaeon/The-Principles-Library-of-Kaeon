Crop
	
	Philosophy
		
		-
			The crop command contains the content "Crop". It will have between two and three
			children, the first of which returns a list, and the second and third of which, if
			present, return numbers.

			The number returned by the second child is referred to as the second number, and the
			number returned by the third child is referred to as the third number. If the third
			child is not present, the third number shall be equal to the length of the list plus
			one.
			
			If the second and third number are equal it will return an empty list.
			
			If the second number is less than the third number, it will run through the list from
			the index specified by the second number to one less than the index specified by the
			third number, appending each element it runs through to a new list. It will then return
			the new list.
			
			If the second number is greater than the third number, it will run through the list
			from the index specified by the third number to one greater than the index specified by
			the second number, appending each element it runs through to a new list. It will then
			return the new list.
			
			If the returned list is in the form of a string, the generated list will be returned as
			a string. Otherwise, it will be returned as a list.
