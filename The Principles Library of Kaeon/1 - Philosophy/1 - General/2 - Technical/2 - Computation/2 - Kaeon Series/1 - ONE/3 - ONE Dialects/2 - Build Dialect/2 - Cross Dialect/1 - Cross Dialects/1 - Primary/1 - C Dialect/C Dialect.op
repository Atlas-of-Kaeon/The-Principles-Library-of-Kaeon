			-
				If the type element has a child with the content "Array", said child may have an
				indefinite number of children, each of which may have either an integer number or
				the string "Null" as their content. Each of said children represents a dimension of
				an array, where a child containing a number represents the length of said dimension
				and a child with the string "Null" represents a dimension of indeterminate length.
				If the array element has no children, the array will be assumed to be a one
				dimensional array of indeterminate length.
			-
		
		Structure
		
			-
				If the type element has a child with the content "Structure", said child must have
				a child with content containing the name of a C struct.
			-
		
		Inline Structure
		
			-
				If the type element has a child with the content "Inline Structure", the children
				of said child shall compose the body of a function analogous to a C struct.

	Notations
	
		Get Pointer
		
			-
				If a notation element in a meta command contains the content "Get Pointer", the
				command in the meta command's scope will be a pointer reference. This effect will
				have reduced scope.
			-
		
		Get Address
		
			-
				If a notation element in a meta command contains the content "Get Address", the
				command in the meta command's scope will be an address reference. This effect will
				have reduced scope.
