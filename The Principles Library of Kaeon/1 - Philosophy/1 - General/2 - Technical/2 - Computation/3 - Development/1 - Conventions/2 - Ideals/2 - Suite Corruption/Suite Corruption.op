Suite Corruption

	Philosophy

		-
			Suite corruption is where engineers are forced to abandon utilities and techniques they
			have grown reliant upon.

	Principles

		1 - The Seven Deadly Sins

			1.1 - Payment

				-
					Payment is when a tool charges for its use, though a freemium model mitigates
					the severity of it.
				-

			1.2 - Signup

				-
					Signup is when a tool requires the submission of user information for its use.
				-

			1.3 - Setup

				-
					Setup is when a tool requires the user to manually register for, or install,
					specialized dependencies, becoming more severe the more manual effort is
					required.
				-

			1.4 - Decay

				-
					Decay is when a tool loses support or compatibility over time.
				-

			1.5 - Rigor

				-
					Rigor is when a tool requires highly specialized knowledge for its use where
					reasonable abstractions are possible to mitigate said barrier.
				-

			1.6 - Excess

				-
					Excess is where the interface of a tool is excessively obtuse, taking its most
					severe form when the tool is only usable through visual interfaces.
				-

			1.7 - Limits

				-
					Limits, the most severe of the seven sins, is when the usage of a tool makes
					certain types of development impossible to perform.
				-

		2 - The Sins of Bondage

			2.1 - Commitment

				-
					Commitment is when the usage of certain tools render others unusable.
					
					Thus, it forces commitment to one stack at the expense of others and renders
					migration itself impossible without restarting from scratch.
				-

			2.2 - Baggage

				-
					Baggage is when a tool cannot be used independently of a specific environment.
				-

		3 - The Wage of Deadlock

			-
				Technical deadlock is when technical debt creates limits which restrict an existing
				project to such a degree that the goals of the project can no longer be reached,
				forcing a complete development reset.
