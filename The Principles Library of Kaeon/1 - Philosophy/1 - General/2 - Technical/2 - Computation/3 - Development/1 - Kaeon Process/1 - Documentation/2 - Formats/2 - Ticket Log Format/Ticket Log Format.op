	Principles

		Ticket Properties

			-
				A ticket shall have a unique numerical ID, a text description, and a status, which
				may be open, meaning that no one is working on it, active, meaning that someone is
				working on it, submitted, meaning that whoever was working on it has submitted it
				for approval, and complete, meaning that it has been successfully completed.

				By default, the status of all tickets is set to open.

				Tickets may be assigned a due date and time, an indefinite number of prerequisite
				tickets which must be completed before itself, an indefinite number of string tags,
				indicating which groups they belong to, and an indefinite number of notes.

				A ticket may also be assigned a numerical class based on its perceived difficulty,
				from one to any arbitrarily high number, where higher numbers represent higher
				difficulty.

				A complete ticket may be assigned a numerical grade on a scale from zero to one,
				corresponding to the quality of the job done, where the higher the number is, the
				better the job. If no grade is specified, the grade shall be assumed to be one.
