The Basic Test

	Philosophy

		-
			A basic test refers to any test designed to confirm functional computacy.
		-

	Principles

		Preparation

			-
				In and of themselves, the essential principles of functional computacy can be
				taught to anyone fairly quickly, in a few hours or less; but mastery sufficient to
				pass the basic test may take longer.

		The General Basic Test

			Format

				-
					The general basic test is a test of functional computacy where the subject is
					to iterate over a list, apply one of two functions to each element of the list
					according to whether the index is odd or even, append the return values of said
					functions to a new list in order, and log the content of the new list at the
					end.
				-

			Default

				-
					The default general test has the original list contain the upper case letters
					of the alphabet, has the first function return the input string converted to
					lower case, and has the second function return a boolean indicating whether the
					input string is included in the string "HELLO, WORLD!".
