Magnitude Perception

	Philosophy

		-
			The perception of the passing of time having a given "speed", and the perception of
			space, matter, and energy having given "magnitudes" are illusions created by conscious
			minds.

			Therefore, in a universe with no sentient entities, any amount of time may as well be
			an instant, and any amount of space, matter, or energy may as well be a speck.
