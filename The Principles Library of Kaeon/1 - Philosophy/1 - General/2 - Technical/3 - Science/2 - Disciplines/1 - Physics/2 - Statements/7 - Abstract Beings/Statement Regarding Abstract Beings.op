Statement Regarding Abstract Beings

	Philosophy

		-
			If chaotra is a component of reality, then chaotrons with sufficient duration and
			scope, as well as chaotrods that exist independent of physical matter could be
			considered abstract beings.

			However, to what extent these entities would have either intelligence or will, and thus
			to what extent they could be considered personal beings, is uncertain.
