	Principles

		Humans

			-
				In order to test on live humans, the subjects must consent to the testing under a
				sound state of mind, having demonstrated a full understanding of what the testing
				entails, and must be given the option to withdraw from the testing at any time.
			-

		Animals

			-
				Tests may be performed on terminally ill non-human animals who reached said state
				due to natural causes, provided the animals are sedated.

				Exceptions to these rules may be made in the case that the testing is projected to
				provide overwhelming benefit to the prognosis of serious human disease, and no
				suitable alternative can be found.
