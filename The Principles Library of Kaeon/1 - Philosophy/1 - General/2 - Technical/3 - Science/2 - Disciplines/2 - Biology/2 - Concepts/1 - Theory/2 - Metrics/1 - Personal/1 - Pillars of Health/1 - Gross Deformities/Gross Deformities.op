Gross Deformities

	Philosophy

		-
			Gross deformities are anatomical abnormalities that, while not life threatening,
			interfere with one's health to an extreme extent, either by way of impeding function,
			or by degrading one's appearance to an extreme degree, and as such ought to be
			classified as diseases in need of urgent treatment, and subject to be covered in the
			same manner as other serious illnesses by both public and private medical coverage.
