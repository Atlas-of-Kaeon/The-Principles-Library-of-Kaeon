Neural Media Rendering

	Philosophy

		-
			Neural media rendering is the process of deriving and recording audio-visual media from
			scans of the brain, thus allowing one's "mind's eye" to be recorded.

			This technique may be augmented by machine learning models, and may be used to enhance,
			or even replace, other methods of media content creation.
