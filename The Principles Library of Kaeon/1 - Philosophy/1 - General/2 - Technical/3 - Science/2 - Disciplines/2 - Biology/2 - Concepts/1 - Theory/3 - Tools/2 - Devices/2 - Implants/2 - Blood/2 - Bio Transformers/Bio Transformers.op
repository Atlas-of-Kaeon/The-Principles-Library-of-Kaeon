Bio Transformers

	Philosophy

		-
			Bio transformers are one of two types of organs or implants, circulatory transformers
			or nervous transformers.

			A circulatory transformer modifies the content of the blood within certain regions of
			the circulatory system while also preventing the altered content of said blood to
			spread to other regions of the circulatory system.

			A nervous transformer alters signals as they pass through the nervous system.
