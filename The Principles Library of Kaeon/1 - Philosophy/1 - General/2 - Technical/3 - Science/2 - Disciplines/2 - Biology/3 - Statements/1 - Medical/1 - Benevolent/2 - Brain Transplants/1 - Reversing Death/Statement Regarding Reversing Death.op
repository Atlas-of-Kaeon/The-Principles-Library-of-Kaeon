Statement Regarding Reversing Death

	Philosophy

		-
			This document specifies a hypothetical procedure which could in theory reverse the
			death of an animal with a brain.
		-

	Principles

		Procedure

			-
				The dead brain shall be revived using necrosis reversal, and once revived, shall
				be transferred to a new body using a brain transplant.
			-

		Basis for Plausibility

			-
				The most powerful evidence of the plausibility of this procedure comes from
				experiments which successfully restored some function to the brain cells of dead
				animals, specifically to the brains of dead pigs.
			-

		Pathway to Viability

			-
				If any progress can be made with regards to necrosis reversal in other types of
				tissue, then research can begin with regards to nerve cells.
			-

		Anatomical Priority

			-
				In terms of preserving the person of the subject during the revival process, the
				regions of the brainstem are of the utmost importance in terms of making sure that
				their properties when revived deviate as little as possible relative to their
				properties before death.
			-

		Rate of Restoration

			-
				The extent to which the original person is preserved through the revival process
				is referred to as the rate of restoration.

				The goal is to maximize the rate of restoration, and while a one hundred percent
				rate of restoration is very unlikely to be achieved, any non-zero rate of
				restoration makes the procedure worthwhile.
			-

		Death Protocol

			-
				Given the possible viability of this procedure or something similar to it, it is
				advisable that one have at least their brain, cranium, and spinal cord preserved to
				the greatest extent possible after their death.
