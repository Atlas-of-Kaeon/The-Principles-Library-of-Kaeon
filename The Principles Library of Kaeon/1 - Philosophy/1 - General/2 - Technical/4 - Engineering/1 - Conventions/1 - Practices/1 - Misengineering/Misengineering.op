Misengineering

	Philosophy

		-
			Misengineering is the practice of intentionally designing a system to function at some
			targeted sub-optimal level.

			Misengineering may be benign, where it is intended to further the aims of the bigger
			picture of some other system, malicious, where it is intended to sabotage a 3rd party's
			work, or exploratory, where its results are intended to factor into the analysis of a
			scientific experiment.
