Battery Swap Station

	Philosophy

		-
			A battery swap station is a facility where rechargeable electric devices, specifically
			vehicles, can have their drained batteries swapped out for charged batteries instead of
			having to recharge them before moving on, thereby greatly decreasing the time it takes
			for them to return to their operations, with the associated costs being solely for the
			labor and power spent in the process.
