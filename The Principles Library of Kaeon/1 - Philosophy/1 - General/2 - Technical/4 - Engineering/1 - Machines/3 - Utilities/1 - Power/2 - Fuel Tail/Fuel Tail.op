Fuel Tail

	Philosophy

		-
			A fuel tail is a hose that can pump fuel into a vehicle to which it is connected while
			said vehicle is in motion, so that said vehicle can conserve the fuel it carries on
			board, if any.

			If said vehicle exits the range of the fuel tail's length, the fuel tail shall
			disconnect from the vehicle.
