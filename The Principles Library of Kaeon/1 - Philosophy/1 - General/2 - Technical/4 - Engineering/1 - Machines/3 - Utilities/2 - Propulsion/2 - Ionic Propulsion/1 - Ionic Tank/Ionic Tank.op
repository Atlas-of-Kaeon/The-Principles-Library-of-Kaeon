Ionic Tank

	Philosophy

		-
			An ionic tank is a tank which carries a gas or liquid which may be channeled through an
			ionic thruster to generate more thrust than merely expelling it, such that said
			thruster may be used in an environment where such gas or liquid is absent from its
			surroundings.
