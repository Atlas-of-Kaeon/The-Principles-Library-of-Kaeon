Top Hat Thruster

	Philosophy

		-
			A top hat thruster is a rocket engine attached to a frame that extends out from the top
			of a rocket, positioned near the payload and above the fuel units, so as to allow fuel
			units to be ejected without sacrificing the engines and thereby needing additional
			engines on another stage to replace them.
