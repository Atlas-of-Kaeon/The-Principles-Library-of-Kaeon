Reactive Aerosol

	Philosophy

		-
			A reactive aerosol is an aerosol or gas that reacts in certain ways only when exposed
			to either certain kinds of light, for a photoreactive aerosol, or to an
			electro-magnetic discharge, for an electroreactive aerosol.

			Any of said reactions can be referred to as activations.
