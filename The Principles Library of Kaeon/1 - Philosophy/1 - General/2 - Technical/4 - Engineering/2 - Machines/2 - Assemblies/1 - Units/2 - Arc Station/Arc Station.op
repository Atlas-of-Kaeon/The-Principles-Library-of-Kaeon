Arc Station

	Philosophy

		-
			An arc station is a space station shaped in the form of a non-elliptic arc, and which
			moves as though it were a portion of a von Braun wheel station, such that it achieves
			similar pseudogravitational properties at a fraction of the scale.

			Placing such a station, or a full von braun wheel, in a geostationary orbit of a
			celestial body would likely minimize fuel requirements.
