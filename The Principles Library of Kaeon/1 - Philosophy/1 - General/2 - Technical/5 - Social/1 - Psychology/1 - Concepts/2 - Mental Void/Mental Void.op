Mental Void

	Philosophy

		-
			The mental void refers to the parts of the mind which the conscious mind lacks direct
			control over, even if the conscious mind is aware of them.

			Beliefs in objective truths, subjective preferences, and spontaneous thoughts generally
			fall into the mental void.
