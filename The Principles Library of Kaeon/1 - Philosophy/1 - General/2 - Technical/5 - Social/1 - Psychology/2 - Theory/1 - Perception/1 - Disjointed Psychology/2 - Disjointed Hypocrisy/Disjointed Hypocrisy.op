Disjointed Hypocrisy

	Philosophy

		-
			A certain degree of hypocrisy can be said to be inevitable in people due to the
			disjointed nature of their psychology.
			
			Therefore, hypocritical or inconsistent behaviour, in many instances, can be said to be
			less of a matter of being two faced than a matter of being two "souled".
