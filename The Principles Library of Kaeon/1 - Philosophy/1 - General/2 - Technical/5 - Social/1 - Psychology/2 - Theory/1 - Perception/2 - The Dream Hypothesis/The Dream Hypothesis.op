The Dream Hypothesis

	Philosophy

		-
			The dream hypothesis is the proposition that dreams, along with hallucinations, near
			death experiences, and other such phenomena occur when certain parts of the brain are
			either inactive or less active than in a fully conscious state, resulting in the rest
			of the brain attempting to make up for the deficient stimuli, that is, to fill in the
			blanks.
