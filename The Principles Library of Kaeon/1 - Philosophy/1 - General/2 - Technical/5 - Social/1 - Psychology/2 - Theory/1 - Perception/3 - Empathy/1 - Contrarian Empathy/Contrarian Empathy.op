Contrarian Empathy

	Philosophy

		-
			Contrarian empathy is when one either experiences empathy for someone generally
			considered depraved, that is positive contrarian empathy, or experiences disgust
			towards someone generally considered noble, that is negative contrarian empathy.

			In the case of positive contrarian empathy, the observer may feel as though they have
			the responsibility to care for someone who, from their perspective, has few others to
			turn to.
