Empathy Barrier

	Philosophy

		-
			An empathy barrier is a phenomenon that occurs when, because someone regards the source
			of another's distress as trivial such that should the same happen to them it would be
			of little to no concern, they may feel little or no empathy towards them, or may even
			feel resentment.

	Principles

		Defensive Resentment

			-
				Defensive resentment occurs when one feels resentment towards another in distress
				and possibly to those who feel empathy for them because said person claims that the
				source of the distress is the subject or their actions.
			-

		Anti-Empathy

			-
				Anti-empathy is a phenomenon where an individual derives sadistic pleasure from
				seeing someone they regard as an enemy in distress.
