Deviance Correlation

	Philosophy

		-
			It is a common trend that, the more one deviates from society in a given aspect, the
			more likely they are to deviate from society in other aspects.

			Thus, those who, for better or for worse, deviate from the mainstream in any
			significant way often possess other idiosyncrasies that cause them to be perceived as
			eccentric.
