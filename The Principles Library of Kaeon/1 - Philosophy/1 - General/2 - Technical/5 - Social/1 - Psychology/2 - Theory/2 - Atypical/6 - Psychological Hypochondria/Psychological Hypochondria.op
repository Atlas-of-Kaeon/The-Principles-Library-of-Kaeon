Psychological Hypochondria

	Philosophy

		-
			Psychological hypochondria is a condition where the subject, for whatever reason, is
			led to falsely believe that they possess a negative pathology that they do not.

			It can however, lead to severe psychological distress and in some cases can cause the
			subject to act, to some degree, as if they did have said pathology due to a self
			imposed placebo effect. In severe cases, it may even affect their natural pathology to
			some degree.
