Uncertainty Vulnerability

	Philosophy

		-
			When one has little faith, or loses faith, in the basic tenets of their worldview, they
			can become very vulnerable to various types of psychological distress.
			
			Conversely, if one is secure in the basic tenets of their worldview, they may be more
			able to withstand things that might otherwise cause them mental distress.

			For this reason, people who lose faith in or reject the basic tenets of their worldview
			are likely to seek out a new worldview to regain their lost sense of security.

			Such rejection often happens due to tragedy or trauma. If the subject is aggressively
			questioned regarding the issues that led them or are leading them to such rejection,
			the effect may be magnified.

			In such a state, they can become highly vulnerable to the power of suggestion, and as
			such can be easily taken advantage of.

			People with malicious intentions often exploit this phenomenon in order to groom people
			for abusive purposes. It is the foundation of several cults.

			Having an arch philosophy with a strong arch principle is one of the best defenses
			against this, as opposed to securing oneself in their career, relationships, or
			possessions, group memberships, or even in paranistic faith, as these are things that
			can be taken away at any moment.

		Paradigm Crisis

			-
				People tend to react very strongly to things and concepts that challenge their
				understanding of the world, in what can be referred to as paradigm crises.

				The earlier said beliefs were formed, the stronger said reactions tend to be.

				Religion is another highly volatile trigger for paradigm crises.
