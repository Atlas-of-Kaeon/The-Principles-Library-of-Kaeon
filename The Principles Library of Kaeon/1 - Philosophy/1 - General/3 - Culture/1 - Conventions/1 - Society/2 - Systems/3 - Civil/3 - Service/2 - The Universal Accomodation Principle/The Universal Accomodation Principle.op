The Universal Accomodation Principle

	Philosophy

		-
			The universal accomodation principle is that a service provider should seek to
			accomodate the needs and preferences of all potential customers, taking into account
			all common minority groups and lifestyles, to the extent that profit, service quality,
			and the difficulty of performing said service are not drastically affected.
