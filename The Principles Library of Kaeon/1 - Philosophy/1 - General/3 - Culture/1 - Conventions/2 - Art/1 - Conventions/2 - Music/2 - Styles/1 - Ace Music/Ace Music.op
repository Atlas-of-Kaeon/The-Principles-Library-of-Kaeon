Ace Music

	Philosophy

		-
			Ace music refers to a genre of music that entirely, or almost entirely relies on high
			reverb bass drums, lyricless choir, lyrical choir, and solo singing. The vocal
			components generally have an intense tone to them.

			Ace music that relies on components other than bass drums and vocals is called hybrid
			ace music.
