		Components
		
			Motors
				
				-
					The PTS motors are motorized modules capable of being mounted to any stable
					surface.
					
					When activated, they reel in a cable using an amount of force that can be
					customized using a digital terminal.
					
					They will cease pulling if their cables reel in too far.
					
					A typical PTS setup should have two motor units.
				-
				
			Switch
			
				-
					The PTS switch is a button that can be strapped to a barbell or dumbbell bar.
					
					They can be synced with an indefinite number of motor units using said motor
					unit's terminal.
					
					When pressed, the motors the switch is synced with will gradually escalate the
					force they reel in with from zero to the force they are set to, and will stop
					outputting force immediately when the switch is released.

			Hooks
			
				-
					A hook is a unit that connects the end of a motor's cable to a barbell or
					dumbbell bar.
