Pseudotransliteration

	Philosophy
	
		-
			Pseudotransliteration is the use of characters from one language to write text in
			another in a way such that the text is readable but also such that the phonetic
			pronunciation of the text does not match what is written.

			Pseudotransliteration can occur when a transliteration map is used in reverse.
