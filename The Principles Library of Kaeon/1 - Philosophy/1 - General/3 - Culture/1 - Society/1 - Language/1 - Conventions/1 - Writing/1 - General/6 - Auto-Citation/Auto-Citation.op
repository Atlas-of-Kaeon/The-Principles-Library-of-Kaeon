Auto-Citation

	Philosophy

		-
			Auto-citation is the use of an automatic process to detect references to external
			sources in text based on both local and online data, and to automatically generate a
			log of citations for said references.

			Such processes may operate in real time as both the target documents and their sources
			are modified.
