Rosetta Document

	Philosophy

		-
			A rosetta document is a text sample that can be said to utilize the majority of the
			essential words of the language in which it is composed, such that learning to read and
			understand it can demonstrate a working knowledge of said language, and such that
			translating in into another language can be useful in language study or creation.

			Ideally a rosetta document short be as brief as possible within the parameters of its
			functions.
