Music Map

	Philosophy

		-
			A music map is a codified protocol for a text which specifies the time to wait between
			each syllable and the pitch with which to recite said syllable.

			A music map which only specifies the former is called a rhythm map, and a music map
			which only specifies the latter is called a melody map.
