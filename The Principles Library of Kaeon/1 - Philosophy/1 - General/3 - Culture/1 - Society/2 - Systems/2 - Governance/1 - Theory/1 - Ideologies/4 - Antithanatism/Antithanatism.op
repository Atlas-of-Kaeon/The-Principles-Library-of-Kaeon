Antithanatism

	Philosophy

		-
			Antithanatism is an ideology which refutes death, and covers both moral antithanatism,
			which refutes the notion that death is either necessary or good, and practical
			antithanatism, which covers prior practical antithanatism, the refutation of the notion
			that death cannot be prevented, and post practical antithanatism, the refutation of the
			notion that death cannot be reversed.

			Prothanatism refers to that which is against antithanatism.
