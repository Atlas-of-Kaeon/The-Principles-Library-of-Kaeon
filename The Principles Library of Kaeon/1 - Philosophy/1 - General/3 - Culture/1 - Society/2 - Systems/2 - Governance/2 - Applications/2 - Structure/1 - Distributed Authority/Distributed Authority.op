Distributed Authority

	Philosophy

		-
			Distributed authority is the principle of spreading the physical buildings associated
			with authority over a state or other institution over a large area and of conducting
			meetings through online conferences.

			The motive in this approach is to reduce the possibility that the subject of said
			authority would be fatally compromised if a single location were compromised.
