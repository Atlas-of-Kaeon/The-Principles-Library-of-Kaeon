Unit Shift

	Philosophy

		-
			A unit shift is when a unit of measurement is redefined.

			A standard unit shift is when a unit is multiplied or divided by a power of ten. A
			reductive unit shift is when a unit is reduced in size, and a magnified unit shift is
			when a unit is increased in size.
