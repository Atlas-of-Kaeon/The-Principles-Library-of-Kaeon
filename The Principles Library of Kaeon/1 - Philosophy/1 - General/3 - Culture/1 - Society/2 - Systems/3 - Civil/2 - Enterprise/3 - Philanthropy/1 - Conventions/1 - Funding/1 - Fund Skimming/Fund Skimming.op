Fund Skimming

	Philosophy

		-
			When accepting donations for a charitable platform, fund skimming is the practice of
			taking the minimum amount necessary from the donations in order to fund the overhead
			costs of said platform, as opposed to trying to fund said expenses separately.

	Principles

		Transparency

			-
				Any charitable platform that uses fund skimming should be transparent about it and
				about the amount which goes to overhead costs.
