Tithe Station

	Philosophy

		-
			A tithe station is a physical machine or web portal which accepts payment in the form
			of digital transactions or physical currency, and automatically donates the money to
			charity, with the user being given some say as to the recipient, and logs the donation
			in a digital record, and may optionally distribute contribution points in exchange for
			donations.
