Membership Registry

	Philosophy

		-
			A membership registry is a service, ideally with an online platform, that allows users
			to track their memberships and subscriptions for shipments, platforms, and
			institutions, to register for and deregister from said services, to access sub-services
			of said services, and to authenticate registration with said services.
