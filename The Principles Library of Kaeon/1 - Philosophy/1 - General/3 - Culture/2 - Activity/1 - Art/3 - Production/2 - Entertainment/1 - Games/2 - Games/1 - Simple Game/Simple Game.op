	Philosophy
	
		-
			The simple game is a single player turn based game in which the player assumes the role
			of a fighter opposing a monster.

	Principles
	
		Gameplay
			
			Hit Points
			
				-
					The player and the monster each have hit points, representing their vitality.

					At the start of the game, both parties will have some number of hit points.
				-
			
			Moves
			
				-
					The player and the opponent will each have some number of moves, each of which
					will reduce the other's hit points by a different amount when used.
				-
			
			Turns
			
				-
					Every turn, the remaining hit points for each party will be displayed, and the
					player will be prompted to select one of the available moves, which will then
					be used.
					
					If the opponent's hit points are still greater than zero after the player's
					move, they will select one of their moves at random and use it.
				-
			
			End Condition
				
				-
					The game ends when either party's hit points are reduced to zero or lower. At
					that point, the party with the greater number of hit points remaining will be
					declared the victor.
