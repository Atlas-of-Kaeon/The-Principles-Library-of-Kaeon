Logic Games and Physics Games

	Philosophy

		-
			A logic game is a game which operates on turn-based logic, and which can thus be easily
			abstracted and reduced down to a quantified form of its rules and states, and can
			therefore be rendered in various forms.

			A physics game is a game which is dependent on some physical movement or simulation,
			and is thus tied to a specific sort of environment or simulation.
