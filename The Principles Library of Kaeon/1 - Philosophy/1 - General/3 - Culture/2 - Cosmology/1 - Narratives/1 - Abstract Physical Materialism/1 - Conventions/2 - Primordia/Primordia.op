Primordia

	Philosophy

		-
			Primordia is a hypothetical umbrella term for aspects of reality that exist outside of
			or underlie the material contexts of time, space, matter, energy, and force.

	Principles

		Primordions

			-
				A primordion is an individual instance or unit of primordia.
			-

		Primordiomnys

			-
				The collective of all primordia can be referred to as primordiomnys.
			-

		Derivia

			-
				As opposed to primordia, derivia is an umbrella term for referring to things that
				exist in the perceptions of sentient entities which primordia underlies, including
				time, space, matter, energy, and force.

				As such, an individual instance or unit of derivia can be called a derivion, the
				collective of all derivia can be referred to as deriviomnys, and primordiomnys and
				deriviomnys can be referred to collectively as omnys.
			-

		Nature

			-
				It is assumed that the nature of primordia is physical abstraction.
