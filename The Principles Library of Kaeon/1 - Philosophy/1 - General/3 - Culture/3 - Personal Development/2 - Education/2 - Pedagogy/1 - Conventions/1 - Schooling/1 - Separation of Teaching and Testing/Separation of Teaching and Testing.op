Separation of Teaching and Testing

	Philosophy

		-
			The separating of teaching and testing is a proposition of an alternative educational
			model in which pupils progress by taking standardized tests, which they are expected to
			pass before certain points but may take at any time, with any number of repeats.

			As such, teaching and testing would be delivered by separate institutions, and one may
			very well learn enough to pass the tests through independent study.

			A certain set of tests would amount to a "grade", and a certain set of grades would
			constitute a "diploma", but there would also be numerous other tests that exist as
			extra curriculars.

	Principles

		Costs

			-
				As administering tests is not a terribly expensive process, pupils and the
				government could save enormous amounts of money by allowing pupils to study
				independently and to only pay for the tests.

				For underage pupils, the government should cover the costs of the tests and provide
				a public option to cover the costs of the instruction, which should be held to high
				standards.
			-

		Instruction

			-
				As instruction in traditional school would no longer be a necessity, schools would
				be incentivized to increase the quality of their education.

				Additionally, since different students have different learning styles, they could
				choose institutions geared towards their preferred style of instruction.

				If a student is struggling to pass the tests they ought to be passing, social
				workers should step in and suggest an institution that better suits the student's
				needs.

				Furthermore, since self study would be encouraged under this model, a student may
				opt to learn through free or cheap online instruction, and to attend dedicated
				brick and mortar institutions for advanced study.

		Acceleration

			-
				Because students may take the tests at any time, exceptionally gifted or motivated
				students may pass through the tests at a rapidly accelerated pace.

				Such pupils may even be able to enter the work force at a very young age.
