Credit Institution

	Philosophy

		-
			A credit institution is an institution that serves only to test pupils to certify their
			mastery of certain subjects.

			A credit institution does not require any pre-requisite credits, session attendance, or
			application to take a given test, but may or may not charge a fee for each attempt.
