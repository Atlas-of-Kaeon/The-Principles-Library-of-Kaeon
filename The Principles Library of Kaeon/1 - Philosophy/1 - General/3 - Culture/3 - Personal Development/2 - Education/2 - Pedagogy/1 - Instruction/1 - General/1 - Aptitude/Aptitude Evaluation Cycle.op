Aptitude Evaluation Cycle

	Philosophy

		-
			An aptitude evaluation cycle is a process wherein one, the subject, performs a task for
			practice and then evaluates the result of the task relative to a fixed metric, the
			target, which embodies a given level of mastery within the discipline, in order to
			receive a percentage score.

			A score above one hundred percent indicates that one has exceeded the level of aptitude
			embodied by the target.
