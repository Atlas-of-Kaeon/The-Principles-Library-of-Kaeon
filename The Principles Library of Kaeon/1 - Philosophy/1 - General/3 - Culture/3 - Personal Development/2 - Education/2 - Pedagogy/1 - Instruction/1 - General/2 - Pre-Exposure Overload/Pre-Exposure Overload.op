Pre-Exposure Overload

	Philosophy

		-
			By exposing someone to a vast amount of information previously unknown to them, it may,
			despite overwhelming them in the moment, serve to open up their mind to fully
			understand said information more thoroughly and more rapidly as they proceed to revisit
			it at their own pace.
