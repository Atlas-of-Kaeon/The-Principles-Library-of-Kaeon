Akadan

	Philosophy

		-
			An akadan is an individual widely acknowledged to possess superior expertise in their
			field of work or study, be they formally accredited or not, such that using the term to
			address someone is akin to saying "doctor" or "professor", and as such the term may be
			abbreviated to "Ak." when used as a prefix.
