	Principles

		Clean Architectural Auto Infrastructure

			-
				Clean architectural auto infrastructure is architectural auto infrastructure
				wherein buildings exist primarily underground, thereby leaving the surface mostly
				devoid of unnatural structures, allowing portions of the surface to be cultivated
				for beauty. Such buildings must have protections against floods. Additionally,
				various human facilities and dwelling places may exist in aquatic and space
				vessels. Said space based vessels may extend indefinitely into deep space.

				The system will also serve to maximize the well being of wild animals.
