The Living Angaian Creed

	Philosophy

		-
			The Angaian Creed can be thought of as the heart of A-O.

			A consecutive reading of it plays out like a heartbeat, where the heart beat starts
			with Kaeon itself and the Philosophy of Kaeon being defined and asserted as the axis of
			all morality, continues with this perfect ideal being filtered into imperfect reality
			via the Principles of Kaeon, and concludes with one, along with all of Angaia,
			responding to the Wonders of Kaeon with every choice that is made, and the process
			continues so long as sentient entities exist in the universe.

			In this sense, the Angaian creed can be thought of as a living work.
