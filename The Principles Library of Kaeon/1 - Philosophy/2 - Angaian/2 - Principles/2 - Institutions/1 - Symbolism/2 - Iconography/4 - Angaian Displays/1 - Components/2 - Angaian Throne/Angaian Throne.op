Angaian Throne

	Philosophy

		-
			An Angaian throne is a cylindrical pedestal with a flat base and curved edges along the
			top, with the rear edge of the top extending upwards to form a tall back which tapers
			off to a single peak in the middle, said back portion containing a large central gap
			with a slot in its base into which an Angaian rod may be inserted, and with a spire
			atop the back upon which an Angaian crown may be mounted.

			By default, the throne should be white.
