Angaian Dais

	Philosophy

		-
			An Angaian dais is a crescent shaped table, reaching up to approximately a meter in the
			middle and tapering towards the ground at the extremes, with the tabletop split into
			two sections lengthwise, each section slanted slightly outwards relative to the central
			split.

			The dais shall be white by default, and the middle of its front side shall have the
			Angaian coat of arms printed on it.
