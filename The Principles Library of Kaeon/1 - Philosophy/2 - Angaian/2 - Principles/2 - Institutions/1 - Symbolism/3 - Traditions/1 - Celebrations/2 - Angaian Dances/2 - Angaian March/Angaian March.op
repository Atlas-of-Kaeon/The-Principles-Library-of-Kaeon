Angaian March

	Philosophy

		-
			An Angaian march is a parade which may occur upon the raising of a sentient entity from
			the dead.

			The parade shall feature said sentient entity at the front, with a large vessel full of
			money and other items to be donated to charity upon the parade's conclusion held by
			multiple people walking behind said sentient entity. All participants except said
			sentient entity shall have their faces covered, ideally with Angaian Regalia.
