		Standard Ace New Body

			-
				A standard ace new body is an ace new body in the form of a full body flying suit,
				which can function as the underdress of the Angaian ceremonial dress, with an
				Angaian crown as the headpiece and primary interface, into which the whole of the
				suit may collapse, and which itself may collapse as needed.
